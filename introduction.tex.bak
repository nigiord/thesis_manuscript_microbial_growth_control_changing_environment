\chapter{Introduction}

\section*{Summary}

In this section, we present the topic of microorganism growth, in particular the recent focus which is made on resource allocation, and discuss some of the limitations of those studies.
We describe the self-replicator approach, and how we're going to apply it in dynamical conditions.

Summary: 
\section{Context and motivations}

- Resource allocation is a fundamental process of self-replication (and so life in general).
- General growth laws (of resource allocation) are needed and under intense investigation those years
- They lay on the assumption of growth rate maximization, which has a long story of successes in microbiology
- Most of the work is done at balanced growth (for a lot of experimental and theoretical reasons)
- But life is dynamic, so is the environment in which micro-organisms live
- What happens outside the steady-state? We have examples in biology for which a dynamical perspective was essential.
Wouldn't it be the same for growth laws?
- Hence, more and more investigators focus on dynamic growth laws

\section{Problem statement}

- Is growth rate maximization still relevant in dynamical conditions?
- Is considering balanced-growth a critical assumption to understand growth control strategies?
- Can we gain additional information by considering the variable nature of the environment?

\section{Approach}

- We use a self-replicator model which is presented here, inspired by the work of Molenaar et al.
- We describe the assumptions and the mathematical description of the system.
- We introduce how we're going to use it at balanced and unbalanced growth, what will be considered as "the environment"
and what will be considered as "Biomass".
- We describe what experimental measures will be needed (GEM abundance and growth rate) to validate the model predictions,
and introduce the tool (gene expression reporter) that we used.

\section{Organisation of the dissertation}

- We first make the environment vary, and check what it means to be optimal in a dynamical context. We underline the fact that even in
the naivest approach, being optimal at balanced and unbalanced growth are inherently incompatible.
- But micro-organisms are more clever than that : the environment is indeed dynamic, but so are the organisms!
They can dynamically adapt to the changes.
The problem is now mathematically and experimentally challenging.
For the mathematical part, optimal control theory saved the day.
- The last chapter is about how we tackle the experimental problem of monitoring gene expression machinery in dynamic.
Guided by our theoretical work, we knew exactly what to look for during a growth transition, but the problem was (is?) anyway challenging.
