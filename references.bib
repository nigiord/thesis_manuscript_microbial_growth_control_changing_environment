  abstract = {Cells must adjust their gene expression in order to compete in a constantly changing environment. Two alternative strategies could in principle ensure optimal coordination of gene expression with physiological requirements. First, characters of the internal physiological state, such as growth rate, metabolite levels, or energy availability, could be feedback to tune gene expression. Second, internal needs could be inferred from the external environment, using evolutionary-tuned signaling pathways. Coordination of ribosomal biogenesis with the requirement for protein synthesis is of particular importance, since cells devote a large fraction of their biosynthetic capacity for ribosomal biogenesis. To define the relative contribution of internal vs. external sensing to the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression in yeast, we subjected S. cerevisiae cells to conditions which decoupled the actual vs. environmentally-expected growth rate. Gene expression followed the environmental signal according to the expected, but not the actual, growth rate. Simultaneous monitoring of gene expression and growth rate in continuous cultures further confirmed that ribosome biogenesis genes responded rapidly to changes in the environments but were oblivious to longer-term changes in growth rate. Our results suggest that the capacity to anticipate and prepare for environmentally-mediated changes in cell growth presented a major selection force during yeast evolution.},

  abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

  title = {Shared Control of Gene Expression in Bacteria by Transcription Factors and Global Physiology of the Cell},
  volume = {9},
  doi = {10.1038/msb.2012.70},
  abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by the joint effect of (i) the global physiological state of the cell, in particular the activity of the gene expression machinery, and (ii) DNA-binding transcription factors and other specific regulators. We present a model-based approach to distinguish between these two effects using time-resolved measurements of promoter activities. We demonstrate the strength of the approach by analyzing a circuit involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism in E. coli. Our results show that the transcriptional response of the network is controlled by the physiological state of the cell and the signaling metabolite cyclic AMP (cAMP). The absence of a strong regulatory effect of transcription factors suggests that they are not the main coordinators of gene expression changes during growth transitions, but rather that they complement the effect of global physiological control mechanisms. This change of perspective has important consequences for the interpretation of transcriptome data and the design of biological networks in biotechnology and synthetic biology.
Synopsis
A simple, parameterless mathematical model, in combination with real-time monitoring of promoter activities, shows how control of gene expression in bacteria is shared between transcription factors and global physiological effects.

We present an approach based on a simple, paramaterless mathematical model to analyze the control of gene expression by transcription factors and the global physiological state of the cell.We illustrate the strength of this approach by means of time-resolved measurements of the transcriptional activities of genes in a central regulatory circuit in Escherichia coli.We conclude that global physiological effects rather than transcription factors dominate the control of gene expression during a growth transition.Our results call for a reappraisal of the role of transcription factors, which may be most appropriately viewed as complementing and finetuning global control exerted by the physiological state of the cell.},

By exposing cells to fluctuating conditions using an innovative microfluidic device, we discover that E. coli cells can remember past environments, which accelerates their physiological adaptation. Using a modeling approach combined with experiments, we demonstrate the adaptive advantage of memory for organisms that 1) transmit long-lived intracellular proteins between generations or 2) respond to fluctuations in a history-dependent manner. Our work describes one of the simplest examples of adaptive memory in a living organism and provides significant insights into the behavior of genetic networks under diverse fluctuations, including nutrients, antibiotics, and other environmental stresses.},

  abstract = {When microbes lack the nutrients necessary for growth, they enter stationary phase. In cases when energy sources are still present in the environment, they must decide whether to continue to use their metabolic program to harvest the available energy. Here we characterized the metabolic response to a variety of types of nutrient starvation in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We found that E. coli exhibits a range of phenotypes, with the lowest metabolic rates under nitrogen starvation and highest rates under magnesium starvation. In contrast, the phenotype of B. subtilis was dominated by its decision to form metabolically inactive endospores. While its metabolic rates under most conditions were thus lower than those of E. coli, when sporulation was suppressed by a genetic perturbation or an unnatural starvation condition, the situation was reversed. To further probe stationary-phase metabolism, we used quantitative metabolomics to investigate possible small-molecule signals that may regulate the metabolic rate of E. coli and initiate sporulation in B. subtilis. We hypothesize a role for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in regulating E. coli glucose uptake and for the redox cofactors NAD(H) and NADP(H) in initiation of sporulation. Our work is directly relevant to synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, where active metabolism during stationary phase, which uncouples production from growth, remains an elusive goal.},

We argue that this correlation does not reflect a direct feedback from growth rate to gene expression. Rather, what appears to be a response to growth rate is dominated by environmental sensing. External parameters, such as nutrition or temperature, feed-forward to define gene expression pattern that is tuned to the evolutionary-predicted growth rate. While such a feed-forward strategy requires fine-tuning of signaling mechanisms, and is limited in the range of environments that can be monitored, it enables advanced preparation to physiological changes that predictably occur following environmental switching. The capacity to anticipate and prepare for changing conditions was probably a major selection force during yeast evolution.},

  abstract = {Microbes respond to changing environments by adjusting gene expression levels to the demand for the corresponding proteins. Adjusting protein levels is slow, consequently cells may reach the optimal protein level only by a time when the demand changed again. It is therefore not a priori clear whether expression "on demand" is always the optimal strategy. Indeed, many genes are constitutively expressed at intermediate levels, which represents a permanent cost but provides an immediate benefit when the protein is needed. Which are the conditions that select for a responsive or a constitutive expression strategy, what determines the optimal constitutive expression level in a changing environment, and how is the fitness of the two strategies affected by gene expression noise? Based on an established model of the lac- and gal-operon expression dynamics, we study the fitness of a constitutive and a responsive expression strategy in time-varying environments. We find that the optimal constitutive expression level differs from the average demand for the gene product and from the average optimal expression level; depending on the shape of the growth rate function, the optimal expression level either provides intermediate fitness in all environments, or maximizes fitness in only one of them. We find that constitutive expression can provide higher fitness than responsive expression even when regulatory machinery comes at no cost, and we determine the minimal response rate necessary for "expression on demand" to confer a benefit. Environmental and inter-cellular noise favor the responsive strategy while reducing fitness of the constitutive one. Our results show the interplay between the demand-frequency for a gene product, the genetic response rate, and the fitness, and address important questions on the evolution of gene regulation. Some of our predictions agree with recent yeast high throughput data, for others we propose the experiments that are needed to verify them.},

The machinery underpinning the cell division cycle is well characterized, but the actual cue(s) driving the cell division cycle remains unknown. In rapidly growing and dividing yeast cells, this cue has been proposed to be cell size. Presumably, a mechanism communicating cell size acts as gatekeeper for the cell division cycle via the G(1) network, which triggers G(1) exit only when a critical size has been reached. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis with a minimal core model linking metabolism, growth and the cell division cycle. Using this model, we (a) present support for coordinated regulation of G(1) /S and G(2) /M transition in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to altered growth conditions, (b) illustrate the intrinsic antagonism between G(1) progression and cell size and (c) provide evidence that the coupling of growth and division is sufficient to allow for size homeostasis without directly communicating or measuring cell size. We show that even with a rudimentary version of the G(1) network consisting of a single unregulated cyclin, size homeostasis is maintained in populations during autocatalytic growth when the geometric constraint on nutrient supply is considered. Taken together, our results support the notion that cell size is a consequence rather than a regulator of growth and division.},

Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically and symmetrically dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 10(5) individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death.},

  abstract = {E. coli is widely used for systems biology research; there exists a need, however, for tools that can be used to accurately and comprehensively measure expression dynamics in individual living cells. To address this we present a library of transcriptional fusions of gfp to each of about 2,000 different promoters in E. coli K12, covering the great majority of the promoters in the organism. Each promoter fusion is expressed from a low-copy plasmid. We demonstrate that this library can be used to obtain highly accurate dynamic measurements of promoter activity on a genomic scale, in a glucose-lactose diauxic shift experiment. The library allowed detection of about 80 previously uncharacterized transcription units in E. coli, including putative internal promoters within previously known operons, such as the lac operon. This library can serve as a tool for accurate, high-resolution analysis of transcription networks in living E. coli cells.},

The accumulation of ppGpp reduces the synthesis of additional ribosomes and thereby reduces the consumption of amino acids which, in turn, allows the remaining ribosomes to function at a higher rate. Here we have described with supporting evidence the proposed feedback loop in greater detail and provided a mathematical analysis which predicts that the SpoT ppGpp synthetase activity should be highest when the ribosomes function at their half-maximal rate. This prediction is consistent with reported observations and is independent of the particular (unknown) mechanism by which the rate of translation controls the ppGpp synthetase activity of SpoT.},

Protein cost is an important component in the cost-benefit tradeoffs that underlie the evolution of protein circuits, but its origins are still poorly understood. Here, we ask how the protein cost varies during the exponential growth phase of E. coli. We find that cells growing exponentially following an upshift from overnight culture show a large cost when producing unneeded proteins. However, after several generations, while still in exponential growth, the cells enter a phase where cost is much reduced despite vigorous unneeded protein production. We find that this reduced-cost phase depends on the ppGpp system, which adjusts the amount of ribosomes in the cell and does not occur after a downshift from rich to poor medium. These findings suggest that protein cost is a transient phenomenon that happens upon an upshift in conditions and that cost is reduced when ribosomes and other cellular systems have increased to their appropriate steady-state level in the new condition.},

  abstract = {Background
Fluorescent proteins are powerful molecular biology tools that have been used to study the subcellular dynamics of proteins within live cells for well over a decade. Two fluorescent proteins commonly used to enable dual protein labelling are GFP (green) and mCherry (red). Sporulation in the Gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been studied for many years as a paradigm for understanding the molecular basis for differential gene expression. As sporulation initiates, cells undergo an asymmetric division leading to differential gene expression in the small prespore and large mother cell compartments. Use of two fluorescent protein reporters permits time resolved examination of differential gene expression either in the same compartments or between compartments. Due to the spectral properties of GFP and mCherry, they are considered an ideal combination for co-localisation and co-expression experiments. They can also be used in combination with fluorescent DNA stains such as DAPI to correlate protein localisation patterns with the developmental stage of sporulation which can be linked to well characterised changes in DNA staining patterns.

Findings
While observing the recruitment of the transcription machinery into the forespore of sporulating Bacillus subtilis, we noticed the occurrence of stage-specific fluorescence intensity differences between GFP and mCherry. During vegetative growth and the initial stages of sporulation, fluorescence from both GFP and mCherry fusions behaved similarly. During stage II-III of sporulation we found that mCherry fluorescence was considerably diminished, whilst GFP signals remained clearly visible. This fluorescence pattern reversed during the final stage of sporulation with strong mCherry and low GFP fluorescence. These trends were observed in reciprocal tagging experiments indicating a direct effect of sporulation on fluorescent protein fluorophores.

Conclusions
Great care should be taken when interpreting the results of protein localisation and quantitative gene expression patterns using fluorescent proteins in experiments involving intracellular physiological change. We believe changes in the subcellular environment of the sporulating cell leads to conditions that differently alter the spectral properties of GFP and mCherry making an accurate interpretation of expression profiles technically challenging.},

Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia coli's central metabolism and its regulation, fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. coli's central metabolism, we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling metabolites, whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop architectures, closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and therefore, metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously (not requiring upstream sensing and signaling) to fluctuating carbon sources.},

  abstract = {By combining results from previous studies of nutritional up-shifts we here re-investigate how bacteria adapt to different nutritional environments by adjusting their macromolecular composition for optimal growth. We demonstrate that, in contrast to a commonly held view the macromolecular composition of bacteria does not depend on the growth rate as an independent variable, but on three factors: (i) the genetic background (i.e. the strain used), (ii) the physiological history of the bacteria used for inoculation of a given growth medium, and (iii) the kind of nutrients in the growth medium. These factors determine the ribosome concentration and the average rate of protein synthesis per ribosome, and thus the growth rate. Immediately after a nutritional up-shift, the average number of ribosomes in the bacterial population increases exponentially with time at a rate which eventually is attained as the final post-shift growth rate of all cell components. After a nutritional up-shift from one minimal medium to another minimal medium of higher nutritional quality, ribosome and RNA polymerase syntheses are co-regulated and immediately increase by the same factor equal to the increase in the final growth rate. However, after an up-shift from a minimal medium to a medium containing all 20 amino acids, RNA polymerase and ribosome syntheses are no longer coregulated; a smaller rate of synthesis of RNA polymerase is compensated by a gradual increase in the fraction of free RNA polymerase, possibly due to a gradual saturation of mRNA promoters. We have also analyzed data from a recent publication, in which it was concluded that the macromolecular composition in terms of RNA/protein and RNA/DNA ratios is solely determined by the effector molecule ppGpp. Our analysis indicates that this is true only in special cases and that, in general, medium adaptation also depends on factors other than ppGpp.},

This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, establishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow. Our approach can be used to uncover similar design principles in other developmental systems.},

We apply this theory to the well-studied lac operon of E. coli. The present theory explains the shape of this regulation function in terms of temporal variation of the input signals, and of minimizing the deleterious effect of cell-cell variability in regulatory protein levels. We also apply the theory to understand the evolutionary tradeoffs in setting the number of regulatory proteins and for selection of feed-forward loops in genetic circuits.

The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered.

  abstract = {Cellular regulation is believed to evolve in response to environmental variability. However, this has been difficult to test directly. Here, we show that a gene regulation system evolves to the optimal regulatory response when challenged with variable environments. We engineered a genetic module subject to regulation by the lac repressor (LacI) in E. coli, whose expression is beneficial in one environmental condition and detrimental in another. Measured tradeoffs in fitness between environments predict the competition between regulatory phenotypes. We show that regulatory evolution in adverse environments is delayed at specific boundaries in the phenotype space of the regulatory LacI protein. Once this constraint is relieved by mutation, adaptation proceeds toward the optimum, yielding LacI with an altered allosteric mechanism that enables an opposite response to its regulatory ligand IPTG. Our results indicate that regulatory evolution can be understood in terms of tradeoff optimization theory.},

These metabolic networks can be modelled and analysed (computed) to study complex biological functions. In particular, constraints-based in silico models have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates, and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

Experimentally, these fluxes can be measured by (13)C-flux analysis, and there has been a long-standing interest in understanding this functional network operation from an evolutionary perspective. On the basis of (13)C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives. Consistent with flux data from evolved Escherichia coli, we propose that flux states evolve under the trade-off between two principles: optimality under one given condition and minimal adjustment between conditions. These principles form the forces by which evolution shapes metabolic fluxes in microorganisms' environmental context.},

One approach of calculating unknown fluxes (frequently called flux balance analysis) is based on the optimality principle of maximizing the molar yield of biotransformations. Here, the relevance and applicability of that approach are examined, and it is compared with the principle of maximizing pathway flux. We discuss diverse experimental evidence showing that, often, those biochemical pathways are operative that allow fast but low-yield synthesis of important products, such as fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other yeast species. Together with arguments based on evolutionary game theory, this leads us to the conclusion that maximization of molar yield is by no means a universal principle.},

The classical, sometimes conflicting, definitions of steady-state and balanced growth are presented, and a consistent terminology is proposed. The conditions under which a culture in balanced growth is also in exponential growth and in steady-state growth are indicated. It is pointed out that steady-state growth always implies both balanced and exponential growth, and examples in which the converse does not hold are described. More complex situations are then characterized and the terminology extended accordingly. This leads to the notion of normal growth and growth that can be synchronous or otherwise unbalanced but still reproducible, and to the condition of approximate steady state manifested by growth in batch culture and by asymmetrically dividing cells, which is analysed in some detail.},

From this information one can predict that E. coli will have at least two phenotypically distinct cell types and that these will have dual molecular control mechanisms of opposite type for the regulation of certain functions.

  abstract = {Induction of gene expression can be accomplished either by removing a restraining element (negative mode of control) or by providing a stimulatory element (positive mode of control). According to the demand theory of gene regulation, which was first presented in qualitative form in the 1970s, the negative mode will be selected for the control of a gene whose function is in low demand in the organism's natural environment, whereas the positive mode will be selected for the control of a gene whose function is in high demand. This theory has now been further developed in a quantitative form that reveals the importance of two key parameters: cycle time C, which is the average time for a gene to complete an ON/OFF cycle, and demand D, which is the fraction of the cycle time that the gene is ON. Here we estimate nominal values for the relevant mutation rates and growth rates and apply the quantitative demand theory to the lactose and maltose operons of Escherichia coli. The results define regions of the C vs. D plot within which selection for the wild-type regulatory mechanisms is realizable, and these in turn provide the first estimates for the minimum and maximum values of demand that are required for selection of the positive and negative modes of gene control found in these systems. The ratio of mutation rate to selection coefficient is the most relevant determinant of the realizable region for selection, and the most influential parameter is the selection coefficient that reflects the reduction in growth rate when there is superfluous expression of a gene. The quantitative theory predicts the rate and extent of selection for each mode of control. It also predicts three critical values for the cycle time. The predicted maximum value for the cycle time C is consistent with the lifetime of the host. The predicted minimum value for C is consistent with the time for transit through the intestinal tract without colonization. Finally, the theory predicts an optimum value of C that is in agreement with the observed frequency for E. coli colonizing the human intestinal tract.},

  abstract = {In this review, our current understanding of the species Escherichia coli and its persistence in the open environment is examined. E. coli consists of six different subgroups, which are separable by genomic analyses. Strains within each subgroup occupy various ecological niches, and can be broadly characterized by either commensalistic or different pathogenic behaviour. In relevant cases, genomic islands can be pinpointed that underpin the behaviour. Thus, genomic islands of, on the one hand, broad environmental significance, and, on the other hand, virulence, are highlighted in the context of E. coli survival in its niches. A focus is further placed on experimental studies on the survival of the different types of E. coli in soil, manure and water. Overall, the data suggest that E. coli can persist, for varying periods of time, in such terrestrial and aquatic habitats. In particular, the considerable persistence of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 is of importance, as its acid tolerance may be expected to confer a fitness asset in the more acidic environments. In this context, the extent to which E. coli interacts with its human/animal host and the organism's survivability in natural environments are compared. In addition, the effect of the diversity and community structure of the indigenous microbiota on the fate of invading E. coli populations in the open environment is discussed. Such a relationship is of importance to our knowledge of both public and environmental health.},

  abstract = {Issues of regulation and control are central to the study of biological and biochemical systems. Thus it is not surprising that the tools of feedback control theory--engineering techniques developed to design and analyze self-regulating systems--have proven useful in the study of these biological mechanisms. Such interdisciplinary work requires knowledge of the results, tools and techniques of another discipline, as well as an understanding of the culture of an unfamiliar research community. This volume attempts to bridge the gap between disciplines by presenting applications of systems and control theory to cell biology that range from surveys of established material to descriptions of new developments in the field. The first chapter offers a primer on concepts from dynamical systems and control theory, which allows the life scientist with no background in control theory to understand the concepts presented in the rest of the book. Following the introduction of ordinary differential equation-based modeling in the first chapter, the second and third chapters discuss alternative modeling frameworks. The remaining chapters sample a variety of applications, considering such topics as quantitative measures of dynamic behavior, modularity, stoichiometry, robust control techniques, and network identification.

The content of nucleic acids, the number of nuclei, and the average mass per cell increase with faster growth rates in a relatively simple and continuous fashion. At a given temperature, the physiological state depends on the growth rate afforded by the environment rather than on the actual contents of the medium. Organisms grown in media which differ qualitatively but which permit the same growth rate are similar in size and composition. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that cell modulation reflects the mechanisms which control the rate of growth. Such a connection has been established through the following observations.

Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.},

  abstract = {Bacterial growth is crucially dependent on protein synthesis and thus on the cellular abundance of ribosomes and related proteins. Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

  abstract = {The energy source shift-down described in the preceding paper (Molin et al., J. Bacteriol. 131: 7\textendash{}17, 1977) was used to study the effects of shift-down on protein synthesis. The overall rate of protein synthesis was reduced immediately, and to the same extent, in stringent and relaxed strains. The primary effect of the shift was a slowing down of the polypeptide chain growth rate, a finding not previously reported. In stringent strains the normal, preshift rate was reestablished within 2 to 3 min, whereas in relaxed strains the chain growth rate remained low for about 20 min before slowly returning to the normal value, which was reestablished some 50 to 60 min after the shift. Throughout this transition, the stability of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) remained unchanged in both strains. We interpret these findings as evidence of the more rapid reduction of the mRNA pool in the stringent strain after shift-down: we believe that very soon after the shift, the stringent strain reduces its pool of mRNA and with it the number of ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis. In this manner the number of active ribosomes is adjusted to the availability of energy and carbon. The relaxed strain cannot rapidly reduce its mRNA pool, which thus remains large enough to engage a near-preshift number of ribosomes during a prolonged period; as a consequence its ribosomes must work at a reduced rate. The possibility that ppGpp is involved in the control of mRNA production is discussed. After shift-down, the initial part of $\beta$-galactosidase (the auto-$\alpha$ fragment) was produced at a higher rate than complete $\beta$-galactosidase in the relaxed strain, as expected when translation is impeded.},

This machinery may be divided into assimilatory machinery and proliferative machinery. The former type is involved in nutrient uptake, whereas the latter type enables the trichome to grow. The cells in the trichome are faced with an allocation problem: given the availability of nutrients in the environment, how many macro-molecular building blocks should be allocated to the synthesis of assimilatory machinery, and how many to the synthesis of proliferative machinery? We answer this question for a particular model, which is a generalization of the Droop quota model. We formulate a two-dimensional non-linear optimal control problem, corresponding to this model. An optimal allocation regime with a singular segment is derived, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle. We give a direct proof of optimality. We discuss how actual biological cells might implement this optimal regime.},

  abstract = {Pre-steady-state kinetic studies of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase conclusively demonstrate the existence of long-distance pathways of communication through the protein-RNA complex. Measurements of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis reveal a rapid burst of product formation followed by a slower linear increase corresponding to k(cat). Thus, a step after chemistry but before regeneration of active enzyme is rate-limiting for synthesis of Gln-tRNA(Gln). Single-turnover kinetics validates these observations, confirming that the rate of the chemical step for tRNA aminoacylation (k(chem)) exceeds the steady-state rate by nearly 10-fold. The concentration dependence of the single-turnover reaction further reveals that the glutamine K(d) is significantly higher than the steady-state K(m) value. The separation of binding from catalytic events by transient kinetics now allows precise interpretation of how alterations in tRNA structure affect the aminoacylation reaction. Mutation of U35 in the tRNA anticodon loop decreases k(chem) by 30-fold and weakens glutamine binding affinity by 20-fold, demonstrating that the active-site configuration depends on enzyme-tRNA contacts some 40 A distant. By contrast, mutation of the adjacent G36 has very small effects on k(chem) and K(d) for glutamine. Together with x-ray crystallographic data, these findings allow a comparative evaluation of alternative long-range signaling pathways and lay the groundwork for systematic exploration of how induced-fit conformational transitions may control substrate selection in this model enzyme-RNA complex.},

  abstract = {Bacterial populations growing in a changing world must adjust their proteome composition in response to alterations in the environment. Rapid proteome responses to growth medium changes are expected to increase the average growth rate and fitness value of these populations. Little is known about the dynamics of proteome change, e.g., whether bacteria use optimal strategies of gene expression for rapid proteome adjustments and if there are lower bounds to the time of proteome adaptation in response to growth medium changes. To begin answering these types of questions, we modeled growing bacteria as stoichiometrically coupled networks of metabolic pathways. These are balanced during steady-state growth in a constant environment but are initially unbalanced after rapid medium shifts due to a shortage of enzymes required at higher concentrations in the new environment. We identified an optimal strategy for rapid proteome adjustment in the absence of protein degradation and found a lower bound to the time of proteome adaptation after medium shifts. This minimal time is determined by the ratio between the Kullback\textendash{}Leibler distance from the pre- to the postshift proteome and the postshift steady-state growth rate. The dynamics of optimally controlled proteome adaptation has a simple analytical solution. We used detailed numerical modeling to demonstrate that realistic bacterial control systems can emulate this optimal strategy for rapid proteome adaptation. Our results may provide a conceptual link between the physiology and population genetics of growing bacteria.},

Here, based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, a method is developed to solve the corresponding constrained optimal control problem in an almost exclusively analytical way and, thus, to calculate optimal enzyme profiles, when linear, irreversible rate laws are assumed. Three different problem formulations are considered and the corresponding optimization results are derived. Besides the minimization of transition time, we consider an operation time in which 90\% of the substrate has been converted into product. In that case, only the enzyme at the lower end of the pathway rather than all enzymes are active in the last phase. In all cases, biphasic or multiphasic time courses are obtained. The biological meaning of the results in terms of a consecutive just-in-time expression of metabolic genes is discussed.

In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

The simplest examples of chattering arcs of the second kind appear in Fuller's problem, two cases of which are examined in detail. The conditions of chattering of the second kind are analyzed; they are related to the Kelley-Contensou optimality test of singular extremals, also known asGeneralized Legendre-Clebsch conditions; they lead to general solutions and not only to solutions restricted to particular terminal conditions; thus, the phenomenon of chattering is very important (fortunately, these solutions can generally be approximated very closely by simple piecewise continuous controls).

They refer to the fact that, under quite general assumptions, the optimal solutions of a given optimal control problem settled in large time consist approximately of three pieces, the first and the last of which being transient short-time arcs, and the middle piece being a long-time arc staying exponentially close to the optimal steady-state solution of an associated static optimal control problem. We provide in this paper a general version of a turnpike theorem, valuable for nonlinear dynamics without any specific assumption, and for very general terminal conditions. Not only the optimal trajectory is shown to remain exponentially close to a steady-state, but also the corresponding adjoint vector of the Pontryagin maximum principle. The exponential closedness is quantified with the use of appropriate normal forms of Riccati equations. We show then how the property on the adjoint vector can be adequately used in order to initialize successfully a numerical direct method, or a shooting method. In particular, we provide an appropriate variant of the usual shooting method in which we initialize the adjoint vector, not at the initial time, but at the middle of the trajectory.},

  abstract = {Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host\textendash{}circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

In this Review, we outline the coordination of common metabolic tasks, including nutrient uptake, central metabolism, the generation of energy, the supply of amino acids and protein synthesis. Increasingly, a set of key metabolites is recognized to control individual regulatory circuits, which carry out specific functions of information input and regulatory output.

The total observed intracellular metabolite pool was approximately 300 mM. A small number of metabolites dominate the metabolome on a molar basis, with glutamate being the most abundant. Metabolite concentration exceeds Km for most substrate-enzyme pairs. An exception is lower glycolysis, where concentrations of intermediates are near the Km of their consuming enzymes and all reactions are near equilibrium.

The second part describes a systems biology approach to identify the factors and effectors that control the interactions between RNA polymerase and rRNA (rrn) promoters of Escherichia coli bacteria during exponential growth in different media. This analysis is based on measurements of absolute rrn promoter activities as transcripts per minute per promoter in bacterial strains either deficient or proficient in the synthesis of the factor Fis and/or the effector ppGpp. These absolute promoter activities are evaluated in terms of rrn promoter strength (Vmax/Km) and free RNA polymerase concentrations. Three major conclusions emerge from this evaluation. First, the rrn promoters are not saturated with RNA polymerase. As a consequence, changes in the concentration of free RNA polymerase contribute to changes in rrn promoter activities. Second, rrn P2 promoter strength is not specifically regulated during exponential growth at different rates; its activity changes only when the concentration of free RNA polymerase changes. Third, the effector ppGpp reduces the strength of the rrn P1 promoter both directly and indirectly by reducing synthesis of the stimulating factor Fis. This control of rrn P1 promoter strength forms part of a larger feedback loop that adjusts the synthesis of ribosomes to the availability of amino acids via amino acid-dependent control of ppGpp accumulation.},

  doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-7-138},
  abstract = {Background Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is critical for optimal bacterial growth, and in bacterial (and yeast) cells it leads to their selective consumption of a single substrate from a complex environment. However, the root cause(s) for the development of this regulatory mechanism is unknown. Previously, a flux balance model (FBAwMC) of Escherichia coli metabolism that takes into account the crowded intracellular milieu of the bacterial cell correctly predicted selective glucose uptake in a medium containing five different carbon sources, suggesting that CCR may be an adaptive mechanism that ensures optimal bacterial metabolic network activity for growth. Results Here, we show that slowly growing E. coli cells do not display CCR in a mixed substrate culture and gradual activation of CCR correlates with an increasing rate of E. coli cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, CCR mutant cells do not achieve fast growth in mixed substrate culture, and display differences in their cell volume and density compared to wild-type cells. Analyses of transcriptome data from wt E. coli cells indicate the expected regulation of substrate uptake and metabolic pathway utilization upon growth rate change. We also find that forced transient increase of intracellular crowding or transient perturbation of CCR delay cell growth, the latter leading to associated cell density-and volume alterations. Conclusions CCR is activated at an increased bacterial cell growth rate when it is required for optimal cell growth while intracellular macromolecular density is maintained within a narrow physiological range. In addition to CCR, there are likely to be other regulatory mechanisms of cell metabolism that have evolved to ensure optimal cell growth in the context of the fundamental biophysical constraint imposed by intracellular molecular crowding.},

Implicit in the value for some of these parameters is a specific macromolecular control system: the control of the growth rate ($\tau$), the timing of initiation of rounds of chromosome replication (P0), and the regulation of cell division (D). The utility of these relations is illustrated by using updated measurements of the macromolecular composition of E. coli B/r to calculate values for the fundamental parameters and to predict the composition of a mutant which has a defect in the control of DNA replication. Furthermore, the meaning of several often-cited physiological parameters (RNA/protein, RNA/cell and RNA/genome) is examined. The relations presented here show that these parameters and their variation with growth rate are not directly relevant to arguments about control of ribosome synthesis or culture growth.},

The E. coli GlnRS is relatively small with 553 amino acids and a molecular mass of 64.4 kDa and functions as a monomer. The mammalian enzymes are somewhat larger and can be parts of multienzyme complexes. Crystal structures were solved of E. coli GlnRS complexed with tRNA(Gln) and ATP, of this complex containing tRNA(Gln) replaced by unmodified tRNA(Gln), and of three complexes with mutated GlnRS enzymes. The GlnRS molecule consists of four domains, the catalytic site is located in the Rossman fold, typical for class I synthetases, and the reaction mechanism follows the normal adenylate pathway. The enzyme shows many similarities with glutamyl-tRNA synthetase; a common ancestor of both molecules is well established. In the E. coli system recognition of the cognate tRNA has been studied in many details using both natural and artificial mutants of tRNA(Gln) and of the enzyme: GlnRS recognizes mainly conventional parts of the tRNA molecule, namely some bases of the anticodon loop and parts of the acceptor stem.},

We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},

  abstract = {The regulation of metabolic activity by tuning enzyme expression levels is crucial to sustain cellular growth in changing environments. Metabolic networks are often studied at steady state using constraint-based models and optimization techniques. However, metabolic adaptations driven by changes in gene expression cannot be analyzed by steady state models, as these do not account for temporal changes in biomass composition. Here we present a dynamic optimization framework that integrates the metabolic network with the dynamics of biomass production and composition. An approximation by a timescale separation leads to a coupled model of quasi-steady state constraints on the metabolic reactions, and differential equations for the substrate concentrations and biomass composition. We propose a dynamic optimization approach to determine reaction fluxes for this model, explicitly taking into account enzyme production costs and enzymatic capacity. In contrast to the established dynamic flux balance analysis, our approach allows predicting dynamic changes in both the metabolic fluxes and the biomass composition during metabolic adaptations. Discretization of the optimization problems leads to a linear program that can be efficiently solved. We applied our algorithm in two case studies: a minimal nutrient uptake network, and an abstraction of core metabolic processes in bacteria. In the minimal model, we show that the optimized uptake rates reproduce the empirical Monod growth for bacterial cultures. For the network of core metabolic processes, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed metabolic adaptations, such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for different nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the original substrate, and metabolic adaptation to an impending nutrient depletion. These examples illustrate how dynamic adaptations of enzyme expression can be predicted solely from an optimization principle.},

We describe an analytical model that leverages extensive literature data on growth laws to infer the underlying fitness landscape and to draw inferences about what evolution has optimized in Escherichia coli. Is E. coli optimized for growth speed, energy efficiency, or some other property? Experimental data show that at its replication speed limit, E. coli produces about four mass equivalents of nonribosomal proteins for every mass equivalent of ribosomes. This ratio can be explained if the cell's fitness function is the the energy efficiency of cells under fast growth conditions, indicating a tradeoff between the high energy costs of ribosomes under fast growth and the high energy costs of turning over nonribosomal proteins under slow growth. This model gives insight into some of the complex nonlinear relationships between energy utilization and ribosomal and nonribosomal production as a function of cell growth conditions.},

In direct competition, microbial strains with high rates of resource acquisition often outcompete strains with slower resource acquisition but higher yield, reducing the net output of the group. Here, I use mathematical models to analyse the genetic and demographic factors that tip the balance toward either rate or yield. My models clarify the widely discussed roles of kin selection and the spatial structure of populations. I also emphasize the strong effect of two previously ignored factors: demographic aspects of colony survival and reproduction strongly shape the design of metabolic rate and efficiency, and competitive mutants within long-lived colonies favour rate over yield, degrading the efficiency of the population.},

  abstract = {First principles of thermodynamics imply that metabolic pathways are faced with a trade-off between the rate and yield of ATP production. Simple evolutionary models argue that this trade-off generates a fundamental social conflict in microbial populations: average fitness in a population is highest if all individuals exploit common resources efficiently, but individual reproductive rate is maximized by consuming common resources at the highest possible rate, a scenario known as the tragedy of the commons. In this paper, I review studies that have addressed two key questions: What is the evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint on metabolic pathways? And, if so, what determines evolutionary outcome of the conflicts generated by this trade-off? Comparative studies and microbial experiments provide evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint that is driven by thermodynamic constraints that are common to all metabolic pathways and pathway-specific constraints that reflect the evolutionary history of populations. Microbial selection experiments show that the evolutionary consequences of this trade-off depend on both kin selection and biochemical constraints. In well-mixed populations with low relatedness, genotypes with rapid and efficient metabolism can coexist as a result of negative frequency-dependent selection generated by density-dependent biochemical costs of rapid metabolism. Kin selection can promote the maintenance of efficient metabolism in structured populations with high relatedness by ensuring that genotypes with efficient metabolic pathways gain an indirect fitness benefit from their competitive restraint. I conclude by suggesting avenues for future research and by discussing the broader implications of this work for microbial social evolution.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that turnover of nitrogenous (N) compounds (especially proteins) incurs a high respiratory cost. Thus, if protein turnover costs change with temperature, this would influence the dependence of respiration rate on growth temperature. Here, we examined the extent to which protein turnover cost explained differences in N-utilization costs (nitrate uptake/reduction, ammonium assimilation, amino acid and protein syntheses, protein turnover and amino acid export) and in respiration rate with changes in growth temperature. By measurements and literature data, we evaluated each N-utilization cost in Petunia x hybrida petals grown at 20, 25 or 35 degrees C throughout their whole lifespans. Protein turnover cost accounted for 73\% of the integrated N-utilization cost on a whole-petal basis at 35 degrees C. The difference in this cost on a dry weight basis between 25 and 35 degrees C accounted for 75\% of the difference in N-utilization cost and 45\% of the difference in respiratory cost. The cost of nitrate uptake/reduction was high at low growth temperatures. We concluded that respiratory cost in petals was strongly influenced by protein turnover and nitrate uptake/reduction, and on the shoot basis, C investment in biomass was highest at 25 degrees C.},

  abstract = {Maximization of growth rate is an important fitness strategy for bacteria. Bacteria can achieve this by expressing proteins at optimal concentrations, such that resources are not wasted. This is exemplified for Escherichia coli by the increase of its ribosomal protein-fraction with growth rate, which precisely matches the increased protein synthesis demand. These findings and others have led to the hypothesis that E.~coli aims to maximize its growth rate in environments that support growth. However, what kind of regulatory strategy is required for a robust, optimal adjustment of the ribosome concentration to the prevailing condition is still an open question. In the present study, we analyze the ppGpp-controlled mechanism of ribosome expression used by E.~coli and show that this mechanism maintains the ribosomes saturated with its substrates. In this manner, overexpression of the highly abundant ribosomal proteins is prevented, and limited resources can be redirected to the synthesis of other growth-promoting enzymes. It turns out that the kinetic conditions for robust, optimal protein-partitioning, which are required for growth rate maximization across conditions, can be achieved with basic biochemical interactions. We show that inactive ribosomes are the most suitable `signal' for tracking the intracellular nutritional state and for adjusting gene expression accordingly, as small deviations from optimal ribosome concentration cause a huge fractional change in ribosome inactivity. We expect to find this control logic implemented across fast-growing microbial species because growth rate maximization is a common selective pressure, ribosomes are typically highly abundant and thus costly, and the required control can be implemented by a small, simple network.},

  abstract = {An overview is presented of the steady- and transient state kinetics of growth and formation of metabolic byproducts in yeasts.Saccharomyces cerevisiae is strongly inclined to perform alcoholic fermentation. Even under fully aerobic conditions, ethanol is produced by this yeast when sugars are present in excess. This so-called `Crabtree effect' probably results from a multiplicity of factors, including the mode of sugar transport and the regulation of enzyme activities involved in respiration and alcoholic fermentation. The Crabtree effect inS. cerevisiae is not caused by an intrinsic inability to adjust its respiratory activity to high glycolytic fluxes. Under certain cultivation conditions, for example during growth in the presence of weak organic acids, very high respiration rates can be achieved by this yeast.S. cerevisiae is an exceptional yeast since, in contrast to most other species that are able to perform alcoholic fermentation, it can grow under strictly anaerobic conditions.`Non-Saccharomyces' yeasts require a growth-limiting supply of oxygen (i.e. oxygen-limited growth conditions) to trigger alcoholic fermentation. However, complete absence of oxygen results in cessation of growth and therefore, ultimately, of alcoholic fermentation. Since it is very difficult to reproducibly achieve the right oxygen dosage in large-scale fermentations, non-Saccharomyces yeasts are therefore not suitable for large-scale alcoholic fermentation of sugar-containing waste streams. In these yeasts, alcoholic fermentation is also dependent on the type of sugar. For example, the facultatively fermentative yeastCandida utilis does not ferment maltose, not even under oxygen-limited growth conditions, although this disaccharide supports rapid oxidative growth.},

  abstract = {Overflow metabolism in the form of aerobic acetate excretion by Escherichia coli is an important physiological characteristic of this common industrial microorganism. Although acetate formation occurs under conditions of high glucose consumption, the genetic mechanisms that trigger this phenomenon are not clearly understood. We report on the role of the NADH/NAD ratio (redox ratio) in overflow metabolism. We modulated the redox ratio in E. coli through the expression of Streptococcus pneumoniae (water-forming) NADH oxidase. Using steady-state chemostat cultures, we demonstrated a strong correlation between acetate formation and this redox ratio. We furthermore completed genome-wide transcription analyses of a control E. coli strain and an E. coli strain overexpressing NADH oxidase. The transcription results showed that in the control strain, several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiration were repressed as the glucose consumption rate increased. Moreover, the relative repression of these genes was alleviated by expression of NADH oxidase and the resulting reduced redox ratio. Analysis of a promoter binding site upstream of the genes which correlated with redox ratio revealed a degenerate sequence with strong homology with the binding site for ArcA. Deletion of arcA resulted in acetate reduction and increased the biomass yield due to the increased capacities of the TCA cycle and respiration. Acetate formation was completely eliminated by reducing the redox ratio through expression of NADH oxidase in the arcA mutant, even at a very high glucose consumption rate. The results provide a basis for studying new regulatory mechanisms prevalent at reduced NADH/NAD ratios, as well as for designing more efficient bioprocesses.},

These quantities could be described as exponential functions of the growth rates afforded by the various media at a given temperature. The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Time-series observations from reporter gene experiments are commonly used for inferring and analyzing dynamical models of regulatory networks. The robust estimation of promoter activities and protein concentrations from primary data is a difficult problem due to measurement noise and the indirect relation between the measurements and quantities of biological interest.
Results: We propose a general approach based on regularized linear inversion to solve a range of estimation problems in the analysis of reporter gene data, notably the inference of growth rate, promoter activity, and protein concentration profiles. We evaluate the validity of the approach using in silico simulation studies, and observe that the methods are more robust and less biased than indirect approaches usually encountered in the experimental literature based on smoothing and subsequent processing of the primary data. We apply the methods to the analysis of fluorescent reporter gene data acquired in kinetic experiments with Escherichia coli. The methods are capable of reliably reconstructing time-course profiles of growth rate, promoter activity and protein concentration from weak and noisy signals at low population volumes. Moreover, they capture critical features of those profiles, notably rapid changes in gene expression during growth transitions.

From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations.

  doi = {10.1117/12.280797},
  abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

If simple, well-characterized modules can be coupled together into more complex networks with behaviour that can be predicted from that of the individual components, we may begin to build an understanding of cellular regulatory processes from the 'bottom up'. Here we have engineered a promoter to allow simultaneous repression and activation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. We studied its behaviour in synthetic gene networks under increasingly complex conditions: unregulated, repressed, activated, and simultaneously repressed and activated. We develop a stochastic model that quantitatively captures the means and distributions of the expression from the engineered promoter of this modular system, and show that the model can be extended and used to accurately predict the in vivo behaviour of the network when it is expanded to include positive feedback. The model also reveals the counterintuitive prediction that noise in protein expression levels can increase upon arrest of cell growth and division, which we confirm experimentally. This work shows that the properties of regulatory subsystems can be used to predict the behaviour of larger, more complex regulatory networks, and that this bottom-up approach can provide insights into gene regulation.},

For organisms whose body plan is a spherical shell, such as the volvocine green algae, the current (molecules per second) of needed nutrients grows quadratically with radius, whereas the rate at which diffusion alone exchanges molecules grows linearly, leading to a bottleneck radius beyond which the diffusive current cannot meet metabolic demands. By using Volvox carteri, we examine the role that advection of fluid by the coordinated beating of surface-mounted flagella plays in enhancing nutrient uptake and show that it generates a boundary layer of concentration of the diffusing solute. That concentration gradient produces an exchange rate that is quadratic in the radius, as required, thus circumventing the bottleneck and facilitating evolutionary transitions to multicellularity and germ\textendash{}soma differentiation in the volvocalean green algae.},

Because in the past few decades we have come to realize that where there is liquid water on Earth, virtually no matter what the physical conditions, there is life. What we previously thought of as insurmountable physical and chemical barriers to life, we now see as yet another niche harbouring 'extremophiles'. This realization, coupled with new data on the survival of microbes in the space environment and modelling of the potential for transfer of life between celestial bodies, suggests that life could be more common than previously thought. Here we examine critically what it means to be an extremophile, and the implications of this for evolution, biotechnology and especially the search for life in the Universe.},

As part of the PROTECT experiment, spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low-Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return, spores were germinated, total RNA extracted, fluorescently labeled, and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response, SP$\beta$ prophage induction), protein damage (CtsR/Clp system), oxidative stress (PerR regulon), and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated martian conditions. The results are discussed in the context of planetary protection for a hypothetical journey of potential forward contaminant spores from Earth to Mars and their subsequent residence on Mars.

  abstract = {Understanding microbial transformations in soils is important for predicting future carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. This review questions some methods of assessing one key microbial process, the uptake of labile organic compounds. First, soil microbes have a starving-survival life style of dormancy, arrested activity, and low activity. Yet they are very abundant and remain poised to completely take up all substrates that become available. As a result, dilution assays with the addition of labeled substrates cannot be used. When labeled substrates are transformed into 14CO2, the first part of the biphasic release follows metabolic rules and is not affected by the environment. As a consequence, when identical amounts of isotopically substrates are added to soils from different climate zones, the same percentage of the substrate is respired and the same half-life of the respired 14CO2 from the labeled substrate is estimated. Second, when soils are sampled by a variety of methods from taking 10 cm diameter cores to millimeter-scale dialysis chambers, amino acids (and other organic compounds) appear to be released by the severing of fine roots and mycorrhizal networks as well as from pressing or centrifuging treatments. As a result of disturbance as well as of natural root release, concentrations of individual amino acids of \textasciitilde{}10 \&\#181;M are measured. This contrasts with concentrations of a few nM found in aquatic systems and raises questions about possible differences in the bacterial strategy between aquatic and soil ecosystems. The small size of the hyphae (2-10 $\mu$m diameter) and of the fine roots (0.2 to 2 mm diameter), make it very difficult to sample any volume of soil without introducing artifacts. Third, when micromolar amounts of labeled amino acids are added to soil, some of the isotope enters plant roots. This may be an artifact of the high \&\#181;M concentrations applied.},

  abstract = {Nutrient limitation to net primary production (NPP) displays a diversity of patterns as ecosystems develop over a range of timescales. For example, some ecosystems transition from N limitation on young soils to P limitation on geologically old soils, whereas others appear to remain N limited. Under what conditions should N limitation and P limitation prevail? When do transitions between N and P limitation occur? We analyzed transient dynamics of multiple timescales in an ecosystem model to investigate these questions. Post-disturbance dynamics in our model are controlled by a cascade of rates, from plant uptake (very fast) to litter turnover (fast) to plant mortality (intermediate) to plant-unavailable nutrient loss (slow) to weathering (very slow). Young ecosystems are N limited when symbiotic N fixation (SNF) is constrained and P weathering inputs are high relative to atmospheric N deposition and plant N:P demand, but P limited under opposite conditions. In the absence of SNF, N limitation is likely to worsen through succession (decades to centuries) because P is mineralized faster than N. Over long timescales (centuries and longer) this preferential P mineralization increases the N:P ratio of soil organic matter, leading to greater losses of plant-unavailable N versus P relative to plant N:P demand. These loss dynamics favor N limitation on older soils despite the rising organic matter N:P ratio. However, weathering depletion favors P limitation on older soils when continual P inputs (e.g., dust deposition) are low, so nutrient limitation at the terminal equilibrium depends on the balance of these input and loss effects. If NPP switches from N to P limitation over long time periods, the transition time depends most strongly on the P weathering rate. At all timescales SNF has the capacity to overcome N limitation, so nutrient limitation depends critically on limits to SNF.},

Through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, regulatory networks have been elucidated that explicitly link the activation of these sigma factors to landmark events in the course of morphogenesis and to each other through pathways of intercellular communication. Signals targeting proteins to specific subcellular localizations and governing the assembly of macromolecular structures have been uncovered but their nature remains to be determined.},

This phenomenon is based on the heterogeneity of sporulating populations, constituted by at least two cell types: (1) sporulating cells, in which the master regulator of sporulation Spo0A is active, and (2) nonsporulating cells, in which Spo0A is inactive. Sporulating cells produce two toxins that act cooperatively to kill the nonsporulating sister cells. The nutrients released by the dead cells into the starved medium are used for growth by the sporulating cells that are not yet fully committed to sporulate, and as a result, sporulation is arrested. This review outlines the molecular mechanisms of the killing and immunity to the toxins, the regulation of their production and other examples of killing of siblings in microorganisms. The biological significance of this behavior is discussed.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2004.01.006},
  abstract = {This paper summarises recent trends in predictive modelling of microbial lag phenomena. The lag phase is approached from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. First, a definition of lag and an analysis of the prevailing measuring techniques for the determination of lag time is presented. Furthermore, based on experimental results presented in literature, factors influencing the lag phase are discussed. Major modelling approaches concerning lag phase estimation are critically assessed. In predictive microbiology, a two-step modelling approach is used. Primary models describe the evolution of microbial numbers with time and can be subdivided into deterministic and stochastic models. Primary deterministic models, e.g., Baranyi and Roberts [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23 (1994) 277], Hills and Wright [J. Theor. Biol. 168 (1994) 31] and McKellar [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 36 (1997) 179], describe the evolution of microorganisms, using one single (deterministic) set of model parameters. In stochastic models, e.g., Buchanan et al. [Food Microbiol. 14 (1997) 313], Baranyi [J. Theor. Biol. 192 (1998) 403] and McKellar [J. Appl. Microbiol. 90 (2001) 407], the model parameters are distributed or random variables. Secondary models describe the relation between primary model parameters and influencing factors (e.g., environmental conditions). This survey mainly focusses on the influence of temperature and culture history on the lag phase during growth of bacteria.},

The results indicate that growth at low temperature alters or damages the cell in a way that reduces the growth rate. A period of growth at higher temperature is required to correct the damage. Release from glucose repression of the induction of $\beta$-galactosidase occurs at a temperature coincident with low-temperature damage. Derepression may be the damage that results from growth at low temperature.},

Temperature shifts made within the range in which the temperature characteristic, $\mu$, is relatively constant (moderate temperatures) immediately induced growth at the normal exponential rate for the new temperature. Prior incubation at temperatures defined as moderate enabled some yeasts to grow for a few generations at temperatures higher than their normal maximal temperature for growth. Shifts made to or from temperatures above or below those in the moderate temperature range resulted in growth rates that were intermediate between the normal steady-state rates for the initial and final temperatures. A period of transient growth rate at the new temperature outside the moderate temperature range seems to be required before normal steady-state growth rates can be attained after such temperature shifts. The psychrophiles gave transient growth rates only below 10 C, whereas the mesophiles gave transient rates below 20 C.

Death kinetics patterns are presented which form a basis on which to begin the development of nonthermal death models. This will require incorporation of phenotypic, adaptive responses and may be influenced by factors such as the sequence in which environmental constraints are applied. A recurrent theme is that probability (stochastic) approaches are required to complement or replace kinetic models as the growth/no growth interface is approached and microorganisms adopt a survival rather than growth mode. Attention is also drawn to the interfaces of predictive microbiology with microbial physiology, information technology and food safety initiatives such as HACCP and risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Drawing on the latest research in the field, Systems Biology: Mathematical Modeling and Model Analysis presents many methods for modeling and analyzing biological systems, in particular cellular systems. It shows how to use predictive mathematical models to acquire and analyze knowledge about cellular systems. It also explores how the models are systematically applied in biotechnology.  The first part of the book introduces biological basics, such as metabolism, signaling, gene expression, and control as well as mathematical modeling fundamentals, including deterministic models and thermodynamics. The text also discusses linear regression methods, explains the differences between linear and nonlinear regression, and illustrates how to determine input variables to improve estimation accuracy during experimental design.  The second part covers intracellular processes, including enzymatic reactions, polymerization processes, and signal transduction. The author highlights the process\textendash{}function\textendash{}behavior sequence in cells and shows how modeling and analysis of signal transduction units play a mediating role between process and function.  The third part presents theoretical methods that address the dynamics of subsystems and the behavior near a steady state. It covers techniques for determining different time scales, sensitivity analysis, structural kinetic modeling, and theoretical control engineering aspects, including a method for robust control. It also explores frequent patterns (motifs) in biochemical networks, such as the feed-forward loop in the transcriptional network of E. coli.  Moving on to models that describe a large number of individual reactions, the last part looks at how these cellular models are used in biotechnology. The book also explains how graphs can illustrate the link between two components in large networks with several interactions.},

  abstract = {In metabolism, available free energy is limited and must be divided across pathway steps to maintain a negative $\Delta$G throughout. For each reaction, $\Delta$G is log proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain a unified set of concentrations and $\Delta$G for each organism. In glycolysis, we find that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes associated with $\Delta$G near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite concentrations and $\Delta$G are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints.},

Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is~a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report~a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in~vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

  abstract = {In the present study, we developed a detailed kinetic model of Escherichia~coli central carbon metabolism. The main model assumptions were based on the results of metabolic and regulatory reconstruction of the system and thorough model verification with experimental data. The development and verification of the model included several stages, which allowed us to take into account both in~vitro and in~vivo experimental data and avoid the ambiguity that frequently occurs in detailed models of biochemical pathways. The choice of the level of detail for the mathematical description of enzymatic reaction rates and the evaluation of parameter values were based on available published data. Validation of the complete model of the metabolic pathway describing specific physiological states was based on fluxomics and metabolomics data. In particular, we developed a model that describes aerobic growth of E.~coli in continuous culture with a limiting concentration of glucose. Such modification of the model was used to integrate experimental metabolomics data obtained in steady-state conditions for wild-type E.~coli and genetically modified strains, e.g. knockout of the pyruvate kinase gene (pykA). Following analysis of the model behaviour, and comparison of the coincidence between predicted and experimental data, it was possible to investigate the functional and regulatory properties of E.~coli central carbon metabolism. For example, a novel metabolic regulatory mechanism for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate was hypothesized, and the flux ratios between the reactions catalysed by enzyme isoforms were predicted.

  abstract = {Quantitative metabolomics is under intense development, and no commonly accepted standard analytical technique has emerged, yet. The employed analytical methods were mostly chosen based on educated guesses. So far, there has been no systematic cross-platform comparison of different separation and detection methods for quantitative metabolomics. Generally, the chromatographic separation of metabolites followed by their selective detection in a mass spectrometer (MS) is the most promising approach in terms of sensitivity and separation power. Using a defined mixture of 91 metabolites (covering glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, redox metabolism, amino acids, and nucleotides), we compared six separation methods designed for the analysis of these mostly very polar primary metabolites, two methods each for gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). For analyses on a single platform, LC provides the best combination of both versatility and robustness. If a second platform can be used, it is best complemented by GC. Only liquid-phase separation systems can handle large polar metabolites, such as those containing multiple phosphate groups. As assessed by supplementing the defined mixture with 13C-labeled yeast extracts, matrix effects are a common phenomenon on all platforms. Therefore, suitable internal standards, such as 13C-labeled biomass extracts, are mandatory for quantitative metabolomics with any methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of publications have recently examined the occurrence and properties of the feed-forward motif in a variety of networks, including those that are of interest in genome biology, such as gene networks. The present work looks in some detail at the dynamics of the bi-fan motif, using systems of ordinary differential equations to model the populations of transcription factors, mRNA and protein, with the aim of extending our understanding of what appear to be important building blocks of gene network structure.
RESULTS: We develop an ordinary differential equation model of the bi-fan motif and analyse variants of the motif corresponding to its behaviour under various conditions. In particular, we examine the effects of different steady and pulsed inputs to five variants of the bifan motif, based on evidence in the literature of bifan motifs found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (commonly known as baker's yeast). Using this model, we characterize the dynamical behaviour of the bi-fan motif for a wide range of biologically plausible parameters and configurations. We find that there is no characteristic behaviour for the motif, and with the correct choice of parameters and of internal structure, very different, indeed even opposite behaviours may be obtained.
CONCLUSION: Even with this relatively simple model, the bi-fan motif can exhibit a wide range of dynamical responses. This suggests that it is difficult to gain significant insights into biological function simply by considering the connection architecture of a gene network, or its decomposition into simple structural motifs. It is necessary to supplement such structural information by kinetic parameters, or dynamic time series experimental data, both of which are currently difficult to obtain.},

  abstract = {The transcription rate of a gene is often controlled by several regulators that bind specific sites in the gene's cis-regulatory region. The combined effect of these regulators is described by a cis-regulatory input function. What determines the form of an input function, and how variable is it with respect to mutations? To address this, we employ the well-characterized lac operon of Escherichia coli, which has an elaborate input function, intermediate between Boolean AND-gate and OR-gate logic. We mapped in detail the input function of 12 variants of the lac promoter, each with different point mutations in the regulator binding sites, by means of accurate expression measurements from living cells. We find that even a few mutations can significantly change the input function, resulting in functions that resemble Pure AND gates, OR gates, or single-input switches. Other types of gates were not found. The variant input functions can be described in a unified manner by a mathematical model. The model also lets us predict which functions cannot be reached by point mutations. The input function that we studied thus appears to be plastic, in the sense that many of the mutations do not ruin the regulation completely but rather result in new ways to integrate the inputs.},

Here we describe a generic approach to combine numerical optimization methods with biochemical kinetic simulations, which is suitable for use in the rational design of improved metabolic pathways with industrial significance (metabolic engineering) and for solving the inverse problem of metabolic pathways, i.e. the estimation of parameters from measured variables.
RESULTS: We discuss the suitability of various optimization methods, focusing especially on their ability or otherwise to find global optima. We recommend that a suite of diverse optimization methods should be available in simulation software as no single one performs best for all problems. We describe how we have implemented such a simulation-optimization strategy in the biochemical kinetics simulator Gepasi and present examples of its application.

In order to convert population-averaging omics measurement data to intracellular concentrations or cellular copy numbers, the total cell volume and number of cells in a sample need to be known.

In this work, we have determined these basic data for E. coli cells when grown in 22 different conditions so that respective data conversions can be done correctly. First, we determine growth-rate dependent cell volumes. Second, we show that in a 1 ml E. coli sample at an optical density (600 nm) of 1 the total cell volume is around 3.6 $\mathrm{\mu}$l for all conditions tested. Third, we demonstrate that the cell number in a sample can be determined on the basis of the sample's optical density and the cells' growth rate. The data presented will allow for conversion of E. coli measurement data normalized to optical density into volumetric cellular concentrations and copy numbers per cell - two important parameters for systems biology model development.},

Quantitative measurements led to a simple mathematical description of the persistence switch.

Mutations at a locus called cxm specifically block methylglyoxal formation from xylose in the presence of adenosine 3${'}$,5${'}$-monophosphate. Accumulation in medium containing xylose, studied in some detail, is dependent on the ability to utilize xylose and is associated with an increased rate of xylose utilization without changes in levels of xylose isomerase. These results suggest that adenosine 3${'}$,5${'}$-monophosphate results in induction of excessively high levels of an early rate-limiting step in xylose metabolism.

  abstract = {The growth characteristics and acetate production of several Escherichia coli strains were compared by using shake flasks, batch fermentations, and glucose-feedback-controlled fed-batch fermentations to assess the potential of each strain to grow at high cell densities. Of the E. coli strains tested, including JM105, B, W3110, W3100, HB101, DH1, CSH50, MC1060, JRG1046, and JRG1061, strains JM105 and B were found to have the greatest relative biomass accumulation, strain MC1060 accumulated the highest concentrations of acetic acid, and strain B had the highest growth rates under the conditions tested. In glucose-feedback-controlled fed-batch fermentations, strains B and JM105 produced only 2 g of acetate.liter-1 while accumulating up to 30 g of biomass.liter-1. Under identical conditions, strains HB101 and MC1060 accumulated less than 10 g of biomass.liter-1 and strain MC1060 produced 8 g of acetate.liter-1. The addition of various concentrations of sodium acetate to the growth medium resulted in a logarithmic decrease, with respect to acetate concentration, in the growth rates of E. coli JM105, JM105(pOS4201), and JRG1061. These data indicated that the growth of the E. coli strains was likely to be inhibited by the acetate they produced when grown on media containing glucose. A model for the inhibition of growth of E. coli by acetate was derived from these experiments to explain the inhibition of acetate on E. coli strains at neutral pH.},

The layout and operation of a small pilot plant for the continuous culture of bacteria are described. This plant has been operated continuously for periods of up to 4 months without breakdown or contamination of the culture. No alterations in the properties of the organisms studied have occurred during such periods of continuous culture. Results are given of a series of experiments on the continuous culture of Aerobacter cloacae in a chemically defined medium, designed to allow quantitative comparison with the results predicted by the theory. The relative advantages of batch and continuous culture as production processes are discussed, and it is concluded that continuous culture may usually be expected to show a five to tenfold increase in output as compared with a batch process.},

Whereas, in general, UQs are primarily involved in aerobic respiration, the MKs serve as electron carriers in anaerobic respiration. Both UQs and MKs can accept electrons from various dehydrogenases, and may donate electrons to different oxidases. Hence, they play a role in maintaining metabolic flexibility in E. coli whenever this organism has to adapt to conditions with changing redox characteristics, such as oxygen availability. Here, the authors report on the changes in both the size and the redox state of the quinone pool when the environment changes from being well aerated to one with low oxygen availability. It is shown that such transitions are accompanied by a rapid increase in the demethylmenaquinone pool, and a slow increase in the MK pool. Moreover, in exponentially growing cultures in a well-shaken Erlenmeyer flask, it is observed that the assumption of a pseudo-steady state does not hold with respect to the redox state of the quinone pool.},

The advent of molecular genetics in the 1970s and 1980s led to a decline in the popularity of continuous culture as a standard laboratory tool. The current trend of studying global proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics requires reproducible, reliable and biologically homogeneous datasets with which to approach a given problem. The use of continuous culture techniques can aid the acquisition of such data, and continuous cultures offer advantages over biologically heterogeneous batch cultures, where secondary growth and stress effects can often mask subtle physiological differences and trends. This review is intended to remind microbiologists of the value of continuous cultivation in a wide range of biological investigations, and describes some advantages and recent advances in applications of continuous culture in post-genomic studies.},

Current approaches aim at determining the network structure based on genomic-scale data. However, the network connectivity alone is not sufficient to define its dynamics; one needs to also specify the kinetic parameters for the regulation reactions. Here, we ask whether effective kinetic parameters can be assigned to a transcriptional network based on expression data. We present a combined experimental and theoretical approach based on accurate high temporal-resolution measurement of promoter activities from living cells by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmids. We present algorithms that use these data to assign effective kinetic parameters within a mathematical model of the network. To demonstrate this, we employ a well defined network, the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli. We find a strikingly detailed temporal program of expression that correlates with the functional role of the SOS genes and is driven by a hierarchy of effective kinetic parameter strengths for the various promoters. The calculated parameters can be used to determine the kinetics of all SOS genes given the expression profile of just one representative, allowing a significant reduction in complexity. The concentration profile of the master SOS transcriptional repressor can be calculated, demonstrating that relative protein levels may be determined from purely transcriptional data. This finding opens the possibility of assigning kinetic parameters to transcriptional networks on a genomic scale.},

  abstract = {Author Summary A wide variety of methods for the reverse engineering of regulatory networks and the identification of quantitative regulation functions are available. We investigate some common assumptions that are made in the application of these methods to time-series transcriptomics data, in the context of a central module in the motility network of E. coli. We show that these assumptions, which hypothesize that mRNA concentrations are good proxies for protein concentrations and that the gene expression machinery is equally active across different physiological conditions, are often not valid and may lead to biased inference results. We also show how models of gene expression can be used in combination with suitable experimental controls to correct for this bias and improve the inference process. The contribution of our work is thus not the addition of another method to the rich store of available reverse engineering algorithms, but lies in the critical examination of the information provided by the experimental data and new ways to exploit this information in the algorithms. The proposed approach is relevant for a wide range of applications using time-series transcriptomics data. For the motility system under study, it has underlined the importance of global physiological effects, the active degradation of the transcription factor FliA as well as the secretion of the anti-sigma factor FlgM for the network dynamics.},

We examined and compared the proteomic response of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D to growth in aerobic chemostat cultures limited for carbon sources being either glucose or ethanol. To obtain a global overview of changes in the proteome, we performed triplicate analyses using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified proteins of interest using MS. Relative quantities of about 400 proteins were obtained and analyzed statistically to determine which protein steady-state expression levels changed significantly under glucose- or ethanol-limited conditions. Interestingly, only enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism showed a significant change in steady-state expression, whereas expression was only detected in one of both carbon source-limiting conditions for 15 of these enzymes. Side effects that were previously reported for batch cultivation conditions, such as responses to continuous variation of specific growth rate, to carbon-catabolite repression, and to accumulation of toxic substrates, were not observed. Moreover, by comparing our proteome data with corresponding mRNA data, we were able to unravel which processes in the central carbon metabolism were regulated at the level of the proteome, and which processes at the level of transcriptome. Importantly, we show here that the combined approach of chemostat cultivation and comprehensive proteome analysis allowed us to study the primary effect of single limiting conditions on the yeast proteome.},

To identify clusters of genes constituting such diagnostic profiles, we characterized the specific transcriptional responses of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeto growth limitation by carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur. Microarray experiments were performed using cells growing in steady-state conditions in chemostat cultures at the same dilution rate. This enabled us to study the effects of one particular limitation while other growth parameters (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen tension) remained constant. Furthermore, the composition of the media fed to the cultures was altered so that the concentrations of excess nutrients were comparable between experimental conditions. In total, 1881 transcripts (31\% of the annotated genome) were significantly changed between at least two growth conditions. Of those, 484 were significantly higher or lower in one limitation only. The functional annotations of these genes indicated cellular metabolism was altered to meet the growth requirements for nutrient-limited growth. Furthermore, we identified responses for several active transcription factors with a role in nutrient assimilation. Finally, 51 genes were identified that showed 10-fold higher or lower expression in a single condition only. The transcription of these genes can be used as indicators for the characterization of nutrient-limited growth conditions and provide information for metabolic engineering strategies.},

  abstract = {The most fundamental questions such as whether a cell is alive, in the sense of being able to divide or to form a colony, may sometimes be very hard to answer, since even axenic microbial cultures are extremely heterogeneous. Analyses that seek to correlate such things as viability, which is a property of an individual cell, with macroscopic measurements of culture variables such as ATP content, respiratory activity, and so on, must inevitably fail. It is therefore necessary to make physiological measurements on individual cells. Flow cytometry is such a technique, which allows one to analyze cells rapidly and individually and permits the quantitative analysis of microbial heterogeneity. It therefore offers many advantages over conventional measurements for both routine and more exploratory analyses of microbial properties. While the technique has been widely applied to the study of mammalian cells, is use in microbiology has until recently been much more limited, largely because of the smaller size of microbes and the consequently smaller optical signals obtainable from them. Since these technical barriers no longer hold, flow cytometry with appropriate stains has been used for the rapid discrimination and identification of microbial cells, for the rapid assessment of viability and of the heterogeneous distributions of a wealth of other more detailed physiological properties, for the analysis of antimicrobial drug-cell interactions, and for the isolation of high-yielding strains of biotechnological interest. Flow cytometric analyses provide an abundance of multivariate data, and special methods have been devised to exploit these. Ongoing advances mean that modern flow cytometers may now be used by nonspecialists to effect a renaissance in our understanding of microbial heterogeneity.},

As the attention has switched to their survival, we are no less impressed by the diversity of mechanisms that aid survival upon exposure to a variety of stresses. Mechanistically, we usually measure adaptation by the changes that occur upon rapid transfer from condition A to B. Implicit in such analyses is the homogeneity of the population of cells in terms of their biochemistry and responsiveness. In contrast, the literature contains many reports of heterogeneity within bacterial populations. A practical importance of such heterogeneity is the ability of a small fraction of any population to survive exposure to stresses that kill the majority of the population. The origins and properties of such organisms have been receiving renewed attention. This brief review considers some of the routes by which heterogeneity is generated in bacterial populations and suggests that such inherent transient diversity in phenotype of individual cells is a survival aid.},

Here we show that [PSI +] provides the means to uncover hidden genetic variation and produce new heritable phenotypes. Moreover, in each of the seven genetic backgrounds tested, the constellation of phenotypes produced was unique. We propose that the epigenetic and metastable nature of [PSI +] inheritance allows yeast cells to exploit pre-existing genetic variation to thrive in fluctuating environments. Further, the capacity of [PSI +] to convert previously neutral genetic variation to a non-neutral state may facilitate the evolution of new traits.},

To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell. We found that such noise is gene-specific and not dependent on the regulatory pathway or absolute rate of expression. We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression.

Visual Overview
SynopsisThe long-term goal of biomedical research has always been the complete understanding of biological systems. In the last century, reductionist approaches proved immensely powerful in elucidating many biochemical, genetic, and molecular mechanisms. In this century, we are entering a more synthetic phase in which we will accomplish the goal of completely understanding biological systems in their incredible living complexity. This understanding will be expressed in a number of models, ranging from traditional biological understanding (where individuals construct models in their heads) to formal mathematical models. In any case, reaching a complete understanding requires an unprecedented standardization and completeness of data, greatly improved methods of accessing and linking information, and improved techniques and approaches for mathematical modeling.E. coli K-12 is the best-characterized organism at the molecular level. In the accompanying report, we describe its highly accurate sequence (Hayashi et al, 2006), perhaps more accurate than of any genome of similar size, maybe even error free. Determination of a highly accurate sequence provided the impetus for re-annotation of its genome (Riley et al, 2006), which is of fundamental importance to studies not only of E. coli biology but also of other organisms because properties of more than half of its gene products have been experimentally determined.More than a half-century of experimental investigation has led to the identification of nearly all the metabolic reactions and the small molecule metabolites involved therein. Many of the regulatory circuits have been identified and computational methods for the predication of many regulatory sites are available. It is thus a truism that `\ldots{} all cell biologists have two cells of interest, the one they are studying and Escherichia coli' (Neidhardt, 1996). E. coli has the further advantage of being a simple unicellular organism without as extensive an elaboration of compartments and transport mechanisms as are present even in simple eukaryotes such as yeast (Figure 7, Holden, 2002). The completeness of our knowledge and the relative simplicity of E. coli provide compelling reasons for choosing it as the first cellular system to be targeted for complete understanding. This was clearly seen by Francis Crick when in 1973 (Crick, 1973) he proposed `Project K: the complete solution of E. coli.' Of course, his suggestion was hopelessly premature, being before many key technologies, rapid computation, and the web (Crick, 2002).With a goal towards complete understanding of E. coli as a simple cellular system, we have begun the construction of uniformly designed and comprehensively prepared resources. Here, we describe a complete set of precisely defined, single-gene deletions of nonessential E. coli K-12 genes. These mutants were constructed by using a PCR gene replacement method similar to the one used to create a nearly complete set of yeast gene mutants (Giaever et al, 2002), except by using E. coli cells carrying a plasmid expressing the highly efficient $\lambda$ Red recombinase (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000) (Figure 8).Deletions were obtained for 3985 of 4288 targeted genes. Based on finding mutants with the predicted structures, the majority of these 3985 genes are probably nonessential. Because a small fraction (ca. 0.2\%) of cells are predicted to contain genetic duplications (Anderson and Roth, 1977), a small number of these 3985 genes may in fact be essential. The majority of the 303 genes for which no mutants were obtained are candidates for essential genes, at least under our selection conditions (aerobic growth on a complex medium at 37$^\circ$C).In bacteria, genes are often arranged in operons that are transcribed as a unit and in which neighboring genes frequently overlap a few to several nucleotides. In such arrangements, mutation of a single gene can simultaneously affect function of neighboring or downstream genes. To circumvent these kinds of problems, mutants were designed taking into account gene organization to avoid affecting properties of more than one gene simultaneously. All mutants contain a kanamycin resistance cassette in place of the gene coding region. In most cases, the coding region from the 2nd through the 7th codon from the C-terminus has been deleted. The kanamycin resistance gene is oriented for expression of downstream genes (Figure 8A). Further, the mutants were constructed by use of a resistance cassette that can be easily eliminated (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). The resultant kanamycin-sensitive derivatives are predicted to encode a small in-frame peptide in place of the mutated gene, in order to reduce effects on expression of downstream genes (Figure 8B).Results of profiling the mutants for growth on synthetic and rich media are described in the manuscript. These mutants provide a new basic resource not only for systematic functional genomics studies but also experimental data source for systems biology approaches. By providing this resource openly to the research community, the authors hope to contribute to worldwide efforts directed towards a comprehensive understanding of the E. coli K-12 model cell. Accordingly, we are making the entire mutant collection freely available for nonprofit, noncommercial use via GenoBase (http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp) for cost of duplication and shipping fees. Commercial and for-profit investigators should contact one of the corresponding authors directly.
A complete set of single-gene deletions of all non-essential genes has been created in E. coli K-12 by replacing coding regions with a kanamycin resistance cassette.Deletions were designed to create in-frame, non-polar mutations upon eviction of the resistance cassette by use of the FLP recombinase.These mutants called the Keio collection provide a new resource for genome-wide functional genomics of the E. coli model cell and whole cell modeling.},

The Keio collection (Baba et al , 2006) has been established as a set of single-gene deletion mutants of Escherichia coli K-12. These mutants have a precisely designed deletion from the second codon from the seventh to the last codon of each predicted ORF. Further information is available at http://sal.cs.purdue.edu:8097/GB7/index.jsp or http://ecoli.naist.jp/. The distribution is now being handled by the National Institute of Genetics of Japan (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/index.jsp). To date more than 4 million samples have been distributed worldwide. As we described earlier (Baba et al , 2006), gene amplification during construction is likely to have led to a small number of mutants with genetic duplications.

The design of the Keio deletions was based on annotations that are now outdated. Of 4288 ORFs targeted, mutants were obtained for 3985 (Baba et al , 2006). Re-annotation based on highly accurate sequencing of E. coli K-12 (Hayashi et al , 2006) led to changing many coding regions and the total number of ORFs to 4296, including pseudogenes (Riley et al , 2006) (Supplementary Table I). The recent E. coli K-12 MG1655 GenBank record (U0096, released in December 2008) has an additional 97 ORFs (exclusive of the ORFs in IS elements, Supplementary Table II) that were not targeted. Of these 4214 annotated ORFs, 4186 were targeted for deletion and 28 were not (Supplementary Table III), which resulted in the isolation of two independent mutants for 3864 targeted ORFs. No deletion was found for 299 ORFs, which are candidates for essential genes. Deletions were also isolated for 23 other ORFs; however, re-annotation led to re-classification of these ORFs as `split ORFs', because their coding \ldots{}},

In order to change the overall codon composition of the messenger pool, we have expressed in E. coli lacZ with the aid of T7 RNA polymerase so that their respective gene products individually accounted for 30\% of the total bacterial protein. Unexpectedly, the maximum expression of either test gene has no specific effect on the relative rates of synthesis of the tRNA species that we studied. Instead, we find that there is a cumulative breakdown of rRNAs, which results in a loss of ribosomes and protein synthetic capacity. After either of the test genes is maximally induced, there is a growing fraction of protein synthesis invested in beta-galactosidase or delta tufB that is matched by a comparable decrease of the fraction of normal protein synthesis. We have also observed enhanced accumulation of two heat shock proteins during overexpression. Finally, after several hours of overexpression of either test protein, the bacteria are no longer viable. These results are relevant to the practical problems of obtaining high expression levels for cloned proteins.},

To address this, we study one of the most significant network motifs, a three-gene circuit called the coherent feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally to perform a basic information-processing function: it shows a delay following ON steps of an input inducer, but not after OFF steps. Here, we ask under what environmental conditions might the FFL be selected over simpler gene circuits, based on this function. We employ a theoretical cost\textendash{}benefit analysis for the selection of gene circuits in a given environment. We find conditions that the environment must satisfy in order for the FFL to be selected over simpler circuits: the FFL is selected in environments where the distribution of the input pulse duration is sufficiently broad and contains both long and short pulses. Optimal values of the biochemical parameters of the FFL circuit are determined as a function of the environment such that the delay in the FFL blocks deleterious short pulses of induction. This approach can be generally used to study the evolutionary selection of other network motifs.},

Here, we study gene expression response to metabolic challenges in exponentially growing Escherichia coli using mass spectrometry. Despite enormous complexity in the details of the underlying regulatory network, we find that the proteome partitions into several coarse-grained sectors, with each sector's total mass abundance exhibiting positive or negative linear relations with the growth rate. The growth rate-dependent components of the proteome fractions comprise about half of the proteome by mass, and their mutual dependencies can be characterized by a simple flux model involving only two effective parameters. The success and apparent generality of this model arises from tight coordination between proteome partition and metabolism, suggesting a principle for resource allocation in proteome economy of the cell. This strategy of global gene regulation should serve as a basis for future studies on gene expression and constructing synthetic biological circuits. Coarse graining may be an effective approach to derive predictive phenomenological models for other 'omics' studies.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1314114111},
  abstract = {Exponentially growing bacteria are rarely found in the wild, as microorganisms tend to spend most of their lifetime at stationary phase. Despite this general prevalence of stationary-phase bacteria, they are as yet poorly characterized. Our goal was to quantitatively study this phase by direct observation of single bacteria as they enter into stationary phase and by monitoring their activity over several days during growth arrest. For this purpose, we devised an experimental procedure for starving single Escherichia coli bacteria in microfluidic devices and measured their activity by monitoring the production rate of fluorescent proteins. When amino acids were the sole carbon source, the production rate decreased by an order of magnitude upon entry into stationary phase. We found that, even while growth-arrested, bacteria continued to produce proteins at a surprisingly constant rate over several days. Our identification of this newly observed period of constant activity in nongrowing cells, designated as constant activity stationary phase, makes possible the conduction of assays that require constant protein expression over time, and are therefore difficult to perform under exponential growth conditions. Moreover, we show that exogenous protein expression bears no fitness cost on the regrowth of the population when starvation ends. Further characterization of constant activity stationary phase-a phase where nongrowing bacteria can be quantitatively studied over several days in a reproducible manner-should contribute to a better understanding of this ubiquitous but overlooked physiological state of bacteria in nature.},

The mother machine (MM) cultivation system is particularly attractive for the long-term investigation of rod-shaped bacteria since it facilitates continuous cultivation and observation of individual cells over many generations in a highly parallelized manner. To date, the lack of fully automated image analysis software limits the practical applicability of the MM as a phenotypic screening tool.   Results We present an image analysis pipeline for the automated processing of MM time lapse image stacks. The pipeline supports all analysis steps, i.e., image registration, orientation correction, channel/cell detection, cell tracking, and result visualization. Tailored algorithms account for the specialized MM layout to enable a robust automated analysis. Image data generated in a two-day growth study ($\approx$ 90 GB) is analyzed in $\approx$ 30 min with negligible differences in growth rate between automated and manual evaluation quality. The proposed methods are implemented in the software molyso (MOther machine AnaLYsis SOftware) that provides a new profiling tool to analyze unbiasedly hitherto inaccessible large-scale MM image stacks.

When the system is time-invariant, this problem is often referred to as deconvolution. Three representative physiological problems, regarding hormone secretion, insulin dynamics, and hepatic glucose production, are used to illustrate the major challenges: ill-conditioning, confidence intervals assessment, infrequent and nonuniform sampling, nonnegativity constraints, and computational efficiency. The paper provides a critical overview of the existing techniques, focusing on regularization theory and Bayesian estimation. In order to overcome some inadequacies of the existing methods, some new results are derived. In particular, the connection between the maximum-likelihood estimate of the regularization parameter and the notion of equivalent degree of freedom is studied. Moreover, a fast SVD-based numerical algorithm is developed that includes the optimization of the regularization parameter, and the computation of confidence intervals. The proposed techniques are validated on a benchmark problem and are shown to provide effective solutions to the three physiological case studies.},
