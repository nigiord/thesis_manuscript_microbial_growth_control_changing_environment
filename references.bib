  abstract = {By combining results from previous studies of nutritional up-shifts we here re-investigate how bacteria adapt to different nutritional environments by adjusting their macromolecular composition for optimal growth. We demonstrate that, in contrast to a commonly held view the macromolecular composition of bacteria does not depend on the growth rate as an independent variable, but on three factors: (i) the genetic background (i.e. the strain used), (ii) the physiological history of the bacteria used for inoculation of a given growth medium, and (iii) the kind of nutrients in the growth medium. These factors determine the ribosome concentration and the average rate of protein synthesis per ribosome, and thus the growth rate. Immediately after a nutritional up-shift, the average number of ribosomes in the bacterial population increases exponentially with time at a rate which eventually is attained as the final post-shift growth rate of all cell components. After a nutritional up-shift from one minimal medium to another minimal medium of higher nutritional quality, ribosome and RNA polymerase syntheses are co-regulated and immediately increase by the same factor equal to the increase in the final growth rate. However, after an up-shift from a minimal medium to a medium containing all 20 amino acids, RNA polymerase and ribosome syntheses are no longer coregulated; a smaller rate of synthesis of RNA polymerase is compensated by a gradual increase in the fraction of free RNA polymerase, possibly due to a gradual saturation of mRNA promoters. We have also analyzed data from a recent publication, in which it was concluded that the macromolecular composition in terms of RNA/protein and RNA/DNA ratios is solely determined by the effector molecule ppGpp. Our analysis indicates that this is true only in special cases and that, in general, medium adaptation also depends on factors other than ppGpp.},

Here, we investigate the design principles governing the dynamics of these proportions during crypt morphogenesis. Using optimal control theory, we show that a proliferation strategy known as a "bang-bang" control minimizes the time to obtain a mature crypt. This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, establishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow. Our approach can be used to uncover similar design principles in other developmental systems.},

Here we address this by presenting a cost-benefit theory for gene regulation functions that takes into account temporally varying inputs in the environment and stochastic noise in the biological components. We apply this theory to the well-studied lac operon of E. coli. The present theory explains the shape of this regulation function in terms of temporal variation of the input signals, and of minimizing the deleterious effect of cell-cell variability in regulatory protein levels. We also apply the theory to understand the evolutionary tradeoffs in setting the number of regulatory proteins and for selection of feed-forward loops in genetic circuits. The present cost-benefit theory can be used to understand the shape of other gene regulatory functions in terms of environment and noise constraints.},

  abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype\textendash{}phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.},

Here, we show that a gene regulation system evolves to the optimal regulatory response when challenged with variable environments. We engineered a genetic module subject to regulation by the lac repressor (LacI) in E. coli, whose expression is beneficial in one environmental condition and detrimental in another. Measured tradeoffs in fitness between environments predict the competition between regulatory phenotypes. We show that regulatory evolution in adverse environments is delayed at specific boundaries in the phenotype space of the regulatory LacI protein. Once this constraint is relieved by mutation, adaptation proceeds toward the optimum, yielding LacI with an altered allosteric mechanism that enables an opposite response to its regulatory ligand IPTG. Our results indicate that regulatory evolution can be understood in terms of tradeoff optimization theory.},

Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

On the basis of (13)C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective optimization theory, we show that metabolism operates close to the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined by competing objectives.

Here, the relevance and applicability of that approach are examined, and it is compared with the principle of maximizing pathway flux. We discuss diverse experimental evidence showing that, often, those biochemical pathways are operative that allow fast but low-yield synthesis of important products, such as fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other yeast species.

Gradually, the focus of the field began to shift from growth physiology to the ever more elaborate molecular mechanisms of regulation employed by the organisms. Advances in systems biology and biotechnology have renewed interest in the physiology of the cell as a whole. Furthermore, gene expression is known to be intimately coupled to the growth state of the cell. Here, we review recent efforts in characterizing such couplings, particularly the quantitative phenomenological approaches exploiting bacterial 'growth laws.' These approaches point toward underlying design principles that can guide the predictive manipulation of cell behavior in the absence of molecular details.},

The classical, sometimes conflicting, definitions of steady-state and balanced growth are presented, and a consistent terminology is proposed. The conditions under which a culture in balanced growth is also in exponential growth and in steady-state growth are indicated. It is pointed out that steady-state growth always implies both balanced and exponential growth, and examples in which the converse does not hold are described. More complex situations are then characterized and the terminology extended accordingly. This leads to the notion of normal growth and growth that can be synchronous or otherwise unbalanced but still reproducible, and to the condition of approximate steady state manifested by growth in batch culture and by asymmetrically dividing cells, which is analysed in some detail.},

From this information one can predict that E. coli will have at least two phenotypically distinct cell types and that these will have dual molecular control mechanisms of opposite type for the regulation of certain functions. In cases for which the molecular data are available for comparison, they are in agreement with the predictions.},

  abstract = {Induction of gene expression can be accomplished either by removing a restraining element (negative mode of control) or by providing a stimulatory element (positive mode of control). According to the demand theory of gene regulation, which was first presented in qualitative form in the 1970s, the negative mode will be selected for the control of a gene whose function is in low demand in the organism's natural environment, whereas the positive mode will be selected for the control of a gene whose function is in high demand. This theory has now been further developed in a quantitative form that reveals the importance of two key parameters: cycle time C, which is the average time for a gene to complete an ON/OFF cycle, and demand D, which is the fraction of the cycle time that the gene is ON. Here we estimate nominal values for the relevant mutation rates and growth rates and apply the quantitative demand theory to the lactose and maltose operons of Escherichia coli. The results define regions of the C vs. D plot within which selection for the wild-type regulatory mechanisms is realizable, and these in turn provide the first estimates for the minimum and maximum values of demand that are required for selection of the positive and negative modes of gene control found in these systems. The ratio of mutation rate to selection coefficient is the most relevant determinant of the realizable region for selection, and the most influential parameter is the selection coefficient that reflects the reduction in growth rate when there is superfluous expression of a gene. The quantitative theory predicts the rate and extent of selection for each mode of control. It also predicts three critical values for the cycle time. The predicted maximum value for the cycle time C is consistent with the lifetime of the host. The predicted minimum value for C is consistent with the time for transit through the intestinal tract without colonization. Finally, the theory predicts an optimum value of C that is in agreement with the observed frequency for E. coli colonizing the human intestinal tract.},

  abstract = {In this review, our current understanding of the species Escherichia coli and its persistence in the open environment is examined. E. coli consists of six different subgroups, which are separable by genomic analyses. Strains within each subgroup occupy various ecological niches, and can be broadly characterized by either commensalistic or different pathogenic behaviour. In relevant cases, genomic islands can be pinpointed that underpin the behaviour. Thus, genomic islands of, on the one hand, broad environmental significance, and, on the other hand, virulence, are highlighted in the context of E. coli survival in its niches. A focus is further placed on experimental studies on the survival of the different types of E. coli in soil, manure and water. Overall, the data suggest that E. coli can persist, for varying periods of time, in such terrestrial and aquatic habitats. In particular, the considerable persistence of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 is of importance, as its acid tolerance may be expected to confer a fitness asset in the more acidic environments. In this context, the extent to which E. coli interacts with its human/animal host and the organism's survivability in natural environments are compared. In addition, the effect of the diversity and community structure of the indigenous microbiota on the fate of invading E. coli populations in the open environment is discussed. Such a relationship is of importance to our knowledge of both public and environmental health.},

  abstract = {Issues of regulation and control are central to the study of biological and biochemical systems. Thus it is not surprising that the tools of feedback control theory--engineering techniques developed to design and analyze self-regulating systems--have proven useful in the study of these biological mechanisms. Such interdisciplinary work requires knowledge of the results, tools and techniques of another discipline, as well as an understanding of the culture of an unfamiliar research community. This volume attempts to bridge the gap between disciplines by presenting applications of systems and control theory to cell biology that range from surveys of established material to descriptions of new developments in the field. The first chapter offers a primer on concepts from dynamical systems and control theory, which allows the life scientist with no background in control theory to understand the concepts presented in the rest of the book. Following the introduction of ordinary differential equation-based modeling in the first chapter, the second and third chapters discuss alternative modeling frameworks. The remaining chapters sample a variety of applications, considering such topics as quantitative measures of dynamic behavior, modularity, stoichiometry, robust control techniques, and network identification.

The content of nucleic acids, the number of nuclei, and the average mass per cell increase with faster growth rates in a relatively simple and continuous fashion. At a given temperature, the physiological state depends on the growth rate afforded by the environment rather than on the actual contents of the medium. Organisms grown in media which differ qualitatively but which permit the same growth rate are similar in size and composition. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that cell modulation reflects the mechanisms which control the rate of growth. Such a connection has been established through the following observations.

  abstract = {The very high concentration of macromolecules within cells can potentially have an overwhelming effect on the thermodynamic activity of cellular components because of excluded volume effects. To estimate the magnitudes of such effects, we have made an experimental study of the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Parameters from cells and cell extracts are used to calculate approximate activity coefficients for cytoplasmic conditions. These calculations require a representation of the sizes, concentrations and effective specific volumes of the macromolecules in the extracts. Macromolecule size representations are obtained either by applying a two-phase distribution assay to define a related homogeneous solution or by using the molecular mass distribution of macromolecules from gel filtration. Macromolecule concentrations in cytoplasm are obtained from analyses of extracts by applying a correction for the dilution that occurs during extraction. That factor is determined from experiments based upon the known impermeability of the cytoplasmic volume to sucrose in intact E. coli. Macromolecule concentrations in the cytoplasm of E. coli in either exponential or stationary growth phase are estimated to be approximately 0.3 to 0.4 g/ml. Macromolecule specific volumes are inferred from the composition of close-packed precipitates induced by polyethylene glycol. Several well-characterized proteins which bind to DNA (lac repressor, RNA polymerase) are extremely sensitive to changes in salt concentration in studies in vitro, but are insensitive in studies in vivo. Application of the activity coefficients from the present work indicates that at least part of this discrepancy arises from the difference in excluded volumes in these studies. Applications of the activity coefficients to solubility or to association reactions are also discussed, as are changes associated with cell growth phase and osmotic or other effects. The use of solutions of purified macromolecules that emulate the crowding conditions inferred for cytoplasm is discussed.},

Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

  abstract = {The energy source shift-down described in the preceding paper (Molin et al., J. Bacteriol. 131: 7\textendash{}17, 1977) was used to study the effects of shift-down on protein synthesis. The overall rate of protein synthesis was reduced immediately, and to the same extent, in stringent and relaxed strains. The primary effect of the shift was a slowing down of the polypeptide chain growth rate, a finding not previously reported. In stringent strains the normal, preshift rate was reestablished within 2 to 3 min, whereas in relaxed strains the chain growth rate remained low for about 20 min before slowly returning to the normal value, which was reestablished some 50 to 60 min after the shift. Throughout this transition, the stability of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) remained unchanged in both strains. We interpret these findings as evidence of the more rapid reduction of the mRNA pool in the stringent strain after shift-down: we believe that very soon after the shift, the stringent strain reduces its pool of mRNA and with it the number of ribosomes engaged in protein synthesis. In this manner the number of active ribosomes is adjusted to the availability of energy and carbon. The relaxed strain cannot rapidly reduce its mRNA pool, which thus remains large enough to engage a near-preshift number of ribosomes during a prolonged period; as a consequence its ribosomes must work at a reduced rate. The possibility that ppGpp is involved in the control of mRNA production is discussed. After shift-down, the initial part of $\beta$-galactosidase (the auto-$\alpha$ fragment) was produced at a higher rate than complete $\beta$-galactosidase in the relaxed strain, as expected when translation is impeded.},

The cells in the trichome are faced with an allocation problem: given the availability of nutrients in the environment, how many macro-molecular building blocks should be allocated to the synthesis of assimilatory machinery, and how many to the synthesis of proliferative machinery? We answer this question for a particular model, which is a generalization of the Droop quota model. We formulate a two-dimensional non-linear optimal control problem, corresponding to this model. An optimal allocation regime with a singular segment is derived, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle. We give a direct proof of optimality.

  abstract = {In the present paper, we study the resource allocation problem for a two-sector economic model of special form, which is of interest in applications. The optimization problem is considered on a given finite time interval. We show that, under certain conditions on the model parameters, the optimal solution contains a singular mode. We construct optimal solutions in closed form. The theoretical basis for the obtained results is provided by necessary optimality conditions (the Pontryagin maximum principle) and sufficient optimality conditions in terms of constructions of the Pontryagin maximum principle.},

  abstract = {Pre-steady-state kinetic studies of Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase conclusively demonstrate the existence of long-distance pathways of communication through the protein-RNA complex. Measurements of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis reveal a rapid burst of product formation followed by a slower linear increase corresponding to k(cat). Thus, a step after chemistry but before regeneration of active enzyme is rate-limiting for synthesis of Gln-tRNA(Gln). Single-turnover kinetics validates these observations, confirming that the rate of the chemical step for tRNA aminoacylation (k(chem)) exceeds the steady-state rate by nearly 10-fold. The concentration dependence of the single-turnover reaction further reveals that the glutamine K(d) is significantly higher than the steady-state K(m) value. The separation of binding from catalytic events by transient kinetics now allows precise interpretation of how alterations in tRNA structure affect the aminoacylation reaction. Mutation of U35 in the tRNA anticodon loop decreases k(chem) by 30-fold and weakens glutamine binding affinity by 20-fold, demonstrating that the active-site configuration depends on enzyme-tRNA contacts some 40 A distant. By contrast, mutation of the adjacent G36 has very small effects on k(chem) and K(d) for glutamine. Together with x-ray crystallographic data, these findings allow a comparative evaluation of alternative long-range signaling pathways and lay the groundwork for systematic exploration of how induced-fit conformational transitions may control substrate selection in this model enzyme-RNA complex.},

  abstract = {Bacterial populations growing in a changing world must adjust their proteome composition in response to alterations in the environment. Rapid proteome responses to growth medium changes are expected to increase the average growth rate and fitness value of these populations. Little is known about the dynamics of proteome change, e.g., whether bacteria use optimal strategies of gene expression for rapid proteome adjustments and if there are lower bounds to the time of proteome adaptation in response to growth medium changes. To begin answering these types of questions, we modeled growing bacteria as stoichiometrically coupled networks of metabolic pathways. These are balanced during steady-state growth in a constant environment but are initially unbalanced after rapid medium shifts due to a shortage of enzymes required at higher concentrations in the new environment. We identified an optimal strategy for rapid proteome adjustment in the absence of protein degradation and found a lower bound to the time of proteome adaptation after medium shifts. This minimal time is determined by the ratio between the Kullback\textendash{}Leibler distance from the pre- to the postshift proteome and the postshift steady-state growth rate. The dynamics of optimally controlled proteome adaptation has a simple analytical solution. We used detailed numerical modeling to demonstrate that realistic bacterial control systems can emulate this optimal strategy for rapid proteome adaptation. Our results may provide a conceptual link between the physiology and population genetics of growing bacteria.},

This criterion is in line with the widely accepted view that high fitness requires high pathway flux. Here, based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, a method is developed to solve the corresponding constrained optimal control problem in an almost exclusively analytical way and, thus, to calculate optimal enzyme profiles, when linear, irreversible rate laws are assumed. Three different problem formulations are considered and the corresponding optimization results are derived. Besides the minimization of transition time, we consider an operation time in which 90\% of the substrate has been converted into product. In that case, only the enzyme at the lower end of the pathway rather than all enzymes are active in the last phase. In all cases, biphasic or multiphasic time courses are obtained. The biological meaning of the results in terms of a consecutive just-in-time expression of metabolic genes is discussed. For the special case of two-enzyme systems, the role of the Golden section in the solution is outlined.},

A number of sophisticated experimental techniques now allow the behavior of individual types of macromolecule to be studied directly in vivo; none, however, allow a wide range of molecule types to be observed simultaneously. In order to tackle this issue we have adopted a computational perspective, and, having selected the model prokaryote Escherichia coli as a test system, have assembled an atomically detailed model of its cytoplasmic environment that includes 50 of the most abundant types of macromolecules at experimentally measured concentrations. Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations of the cytoplasm model have been calibrated to reproduce the translational diffusion coefficients of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) observed in vivo, and "snapshots" of the simulation trajectories have been used to compute the cytoplasm's effects on the thermodynamics of protein folding, association and aggregation events. The simulation model successfully describes the relative thermodynamic stabilities of proteins measured in E. coli, and shows that effects additional to the commonly cited "crowding" effect must be included in attempts to understand macromolecular behavior in vivo.},

Chattering arcs of the first kind are related to the notion of relaxation of the control (i.e., convexization of the maneuverability domain). Some sufficient conditions of equivalence of these notions are defined. Chattering arcs of the second kind appear before and after some optimal singular arcs, for instance, the intermediate thrust arcs of the optimal transfer problem of astrodynamics. The simplest examples of chattering arcs of the second kind appear in Fuller's problem, two cases of which are examined in detail. The conditions of chattering of the second kind are analyzed; they are related to the Kelley-Contensou optimality test of singular extremals, also known asGeneralized Legendre-Clebsch conditions; they lead to general solutions and not only to solutions restricted to particular terminal conditions; thus, the phenomenon of chattering is very important (fortunately, these solutions can generally be approximated very closely by simple piecewise continuous controls). Finally, some special and complex cases appear, some examples of which are analyzed.},

  abstract = {Turnpike properties have been established long time ago in finite-dimensional optimal control problems arising in econometry. They refer to the fact that, under quite general assumptions, the optimal solutions of a given optimal control problem settled in large time consist approximately of three pieces, the first and the last of which being transient short-time arcs, and the middle piece being a long-time arc staying exponentially close to the optimal steady-state solution of an associated static optimal control problem. We provide in this paper a general version of a turnpike theorem, valuable for nonlinear dynamics without any specific assumption, and for very general terminal conditions. Not only the optimal trajectory is shown to remain exponentially close to a steady-state, but also the corresponding adjoint vector of the Pontryagin maximum principle. The exponential closedness is quantified with the use of appropriate normal forms of Riccati equations. We show then how the property on the adjoint vector can be adequately used in order to initialize successfully a numerical direct method, or a shooting method. In particular, we provide an appropriate variant of the usual shooting method in which we initialize the adjoint vector, not at the initial time, but at the middle of the trajectory.},

  abstract = {Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host\textendash{}circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},

  abstract = {The first part of this review contains an overview of the various contributions and models relating to the control of rRNA synthesis reported over the last 45 years. The second part describes a systems biology approach to identify the factors and effectors that control the interactions between RNA polymerase and rRNA (rrn) promoters of Escherichia coli bacteria during exponential growth in different media. This analysis is based on measurements of absolute rrn promoter activities as transcripts per minute per promoter in bacterial strains either deficient or proficient in the synthesis of the factor Fis and/or the effector ppGpp. These absolute promoter activities are evaluated in terms of rrn promoter strength (Vmax/Km) and free RNA polymerase concentrations. Three major conclusions emerge from this evaluation. First, the rrn promoters are not saturated with RNA polymerase. As a consequence, changes in the concentration of free RNA polymerase contribute to changes in rrn promoter activities. Second, rrn P2 promoter strength is not specifically regulated during exponential growth at different rates; its activity changes only when the concentration of free RNA polymerase changes. Third, the effector ppGpp reduces the strength of the rrn P1 promoter both directly and indirectly by reducing synthesis of the stimulating factor Fis. This control of rrn P1 promoter strength forms part of a larger feedback loop that adjusts the synthesis of ribosomes to the availability of amino acids via amino acid-dependent control of ppGpp accumulation.},

  abstract = {Background Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is critical for optimal bacterial growth, and in bacterial (and yeast) cells it leads to their selective consumption of a single substrate from a complex environment. However, the root cause(s) for the development of this regulatory mechanism is unknown. Previously, a flux balance model (FBAwMC) of Escherichia coli metabolism that takes into account the crowded intracellular milieu of the bacterial cell correctly predicted selective glucose uptake in a medium containing five different carbon sources, suggesting that CCR may be an adaptive mechanism that ensures optimal bacterial metabolic network activity for growth. Results Here, we show that slowly growing E. coli cells do not display CCR in a mixed substrate culture and gradual activation of CCR correlates with an increasing rate of E. coli cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, CCR mutant cells do not achieve fast growth in mixed substrate culture, and display differences in their cell volume and density compared to wild-type cells. Analyses of transcriptome data from wt E. coli cells indicate the expected regulation of substrate uptake and metabolic pathway utilization upon growth rate change. We also find that forced transient increase of intracellular crowding or transient perturbation of CCR delay cell growth, the latter leading to associated cell density-and volume alterations. Conclusions CCR is activated at an increased bacterial cell growth rate when it is required for optimal cell growth while intracellular macromolecular density is maintained within a narrow physiological range. In addition to CCR, there are likely to be other regulatory mechanisms of cell metabolism that have evolved to ensure optimal cell growth in the context of the fundamental biophysical constraint imposed by intracellular molecular crowding.},

Implicit in the value for some of these parameters is a specific macromolecular control system: the control of the growth rate ($\tau$), the timing of initiation of rounds of chromosome replication (P0), and the regulation of cell division (D). The utility of these relations is illustrated by using updated measurements of the macromolecular composition of E. coli B/r to calculate values for the fundamental parameters and to predict the composition of a mutant which has a defect in the control of DNA replication. Furthermore, the meaning of several often-cited physiological parameters (RNA/protein, RNA/cell and RNA/genome) is examined. The relations presented here show that these parameters and their variation with growth rate are not directly relevant to arguments about control of ribosome synthesis or culture growth.},

  abstract = {Among the twenty aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase occupies a special position: it is one of only two enzymes of this family which is not found in all organisms, being mainly absent from gram positive eubacteria, archaebacteria and organelles. The E. coli GlnRS is relatively small with 553 amino acids and a molecular mass of 64.4 kDa and functions as a monomer. The mammalian enzymes are somewhat larger and can be parts of multienzyme complexes. Crystal structures were solved of E. coli GlnRS complexed with tRNA(Gln) and ATP, of this complex containing tRNA(Gln) replaced by unmodified tRNA(Gln), and of three complexes with mutated GlnRS enzymes. The GlnRS molecule consists of four domains, the catalytic site is located in the Rossman fold, typical for class I synthetases, and the reaction mechanism follows the normal adenylate pathway. The enzyme shows many similarities with glutamyl-tRNA synthetase; a common ancestor of both molecules is well established. In the E. coli system recognition of the cognate tRNA has been studied in many details using both natural and artificial mutants of tRNA(Gln) and of the enzyme: GlnRS recognizes mainly conventional parts of the tRNA molecule, namely some bases of the anticodon loop and parts of the acceptor stem.},

Here, we investigate the origin of these growth laws by analyzing the features of ribosomal regulation that coordinate proteome-wide expression changes with cell growth in a variety of nutrient conditions in the model organism Escherichia coli. We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},

  abstract = {The regulation of metabolic activity by tuning enzyme expression levels is crucial to sustain cellular growth in changing environments. Metabolic networks are often studied at steady state using constraint-based models and optimization techniques. However, metabolic adaptations driven by changes in gene expression cannot be analyzed by steady state models, as these do not account for temporal changes in biomass composition. Here we present a dynamic optimization framework that integrates the metabolic network with the dynamics of biomass production and composition. An approximation by a timescale separation leads to a coupled model of quasi-steady state constraints on the metabolic reactions, and differential equations for the substrate concentrations and biomass composition. We propose a dynamic optimization approach to determine reaction fluxes for this model, explicitly taking into account enzyme production costs and enzymatic capacity. In contrast to the established dynamic flux balance analysis, our approach allows predicting dynamic changes in both the metabolic fluxes and the biomass composition during metabolic adaptations. Discretization of the optimization problems leads to a linear program that can be efficiently solved. We applied our algorithm in two case studies: a minimal nutrient uptake network, and an abstraction of core metabolic processes in bacteria. In the minimal model, we show that the optimized uptake rates reproduce the empirical Monod growth for bacterial cultures. For the network of core metabolic processes, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed metabolic adaptations, such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for different nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the original substrate, and metabolic adaptation to an impending nutrient depletion. These examples illustrate how dynamic adaptations of enzyme expression can be predicted solely from an optimization principle.},

We describe an analytical model that leverages extensive literature data on growth laws to infer the underlying fitness landscape and to draw inferences about what evolution has optimized in Escherichia coli. Is E. coli optimized for growth speed, energy efficiency, or some other property? Experimental data show that at its replication speed limit, E. coli produces about four mass equivalents of nonribosomal proteins for every mass equivalent of ribosomes. This ratio can be explained if the cell's fitness function is the the energy efficiency of cells under fast growth conditions, indicating a tradeoff between the high energy costs of ribosomes under fast growth and the high energy costs of turning over nonribosomal proteins under slow growth. This model gives insight into some of the complex nonlinear relationships between energy utilization and ribosomal and nonribosomal production as a function of cell growth conditions.},

  abstract = {First principles of thermodynamics imply that metabolic pathways are faced with a trade-off between the rate and yield of ATP production. Simple evolutionary models argue that this trade-off generates a fundamental social conflict in microbial populations: average fitness in a population is highest if all individuals exploit common resources efficiently, but individual reproductive rate is maximized by consuming common resources at the highest possible rate, a scenario known as the tragedy of the commons. In this paper, I review studies that have addressed two key questions: What is the evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint on metabolic pathways? And, if so, what determines evolutionary outcome of the conflicts generated by this trade-off? Comparative studies and microbial experiments provide evidence that the rate-yield trade-off is an evolutionary constraint that is driven by thermodynamic constraints that are common to all metabolic pathways and pathway-specific constraints that reflect the evolutionary history of populations. Microbial selection experiments show that the evolutionary consequences of this trade-off depend on both kin selection and biochemical constraints. In well-mixed populations with low relatedness, genotypes with rapid and efficient metabolism can coexist as a result of negative frequency-dependent selection generated by density-dependent biochemical costs of rapid metabolism. Kin selection can promote the maintenance of efficient metabolism in structured populations with high relatedness by ensuring that genotypes with efficient metabolic pathways gain an indirect fitness benefit from their competitive restraint. I conclude by suggesting avenues for future research and by discussing the broader implications of this work for microbial social evolution.},

Thus, if protein turnover costs change with temperature, this would influence the dependence of respiration rate on growth temperature. Here, we examined the extent to which protein turnover cost explained differences in N-utilization costs (nitrate uptake/reduction, ammonium assimilation, amino acid and protein syntheses, protein turnover and amino acid export) and in respiration rate with changes in growth temperature. By measurements and literature data, we evaluated each N-utilization cost in Petunia x hybrida petals grown at 20, 25 or 35 degrees C throughout their whole lifespans. Protein turnover cost accounted for 73\% of the integrated N-utilization cost on a whole-petal basis at 35 degrees C. The difference in this cost on a dry weight basis between 25 and 35 degrees C accounted for 75\% of the difference in N-utilization cost and 45\% of the difference in respiratory cost. The cost of nitrate uptake/reduction was high at low growth temperatures. We concluded that respiratory cost in petals was strongly influenced by protein turnover and nitrate uptake/reduction, and on the shoot basis, C investment in biomass was highest at 25 degrees C.},

  abstract = {Maximization of growth rate is an important fitness strategy for bacteria. Bacteria can achieve this by expressing proteins at optimal concentrations, such that resources are not wasted. This is exemplified for Escherichia coli by the increase of its ribosomal protein-fraction with growth rate, which precisely matches the increased protein synthesis demand. These findings and others have led to the hypothesis that E.~coli aims to maximize its growth rate in environments that support growth. However, what kind of regulatory strategy is required for a robust, optimal adjustment of the ribosome concentration to the prevailing condition is still an open question. In the present study, we analyze the ppGpp-controlled mechanism of ribosome expression used by E.~coli and show that this mechanism maintains the ribosomes saturated with its substrates. In this manner, overexpression of the highly abundant ribosomal proteins is prevented, and limited resources can be redirected to the synthesis of other growth-promoting enzymes. It turns out that the kinetic conditions for robust, optimal protein-partitioning, which are required for growth rate maximization across conditions, can be achieved with basic biochemical interactions. We show that inactive ribosomes are the most suitable `signal' for tracking the intracellular nutritional state and for adjusting gene expression accordingly, as small deviations from optimal ribosome concentration cause a huge fractional change in ribosome inactivity. We expect to find this control logic implemented across fast-growing microbial species because growth rate maximization is a common selective pressure, ribosomes are typically highly abundant and thus costly, and the required control can be implemented by a small, simple network.},

Even under fully aerobic conditions, ethanol is produced by this yeast when sugars are present in excess. This so-called `Crabtree effect' probably results from a multiplicity of factors, including the mode of sugar transport and the regulation of enzyme activities involved in respiration and alcoholic fermentation. The Crabtree effect inS. cerevisiae is not caused by an intrinsic inability to adjust its respiratory activity to high glycolytic fluxes. Under certain cultivation conditions, for example during growth in the presence of weak organic acids, very high respiration rates can be achieved by this yeast.S. cerevisiae is an exceptional yeast since, in contrast to most other species that are able to perform alcoholic fermentation, it can grow under strictly anaerobic conditions.`Non-Saccharomyces' yeasts require a growth-limiting supply of oxygen (i.e. oxygen-limited growth conditions) to trigger alcoholic fermentation. However, complete absence of oxygen results in cessation of growth and therefore, ultimately, of alcoholic fermentation. Since it is very difficult to reproducibly achieve the right oxygen dosage in large-scale fermentations, non-Saccharomyces yeasts are therefore not suitable for large-scale alcoholic fermentation of sugar-containing waste streams. In these yeasts, alcoholic fermentation is also dependent on the type of sugar. For example, the facultatively fermentative yeastCandida utilis does not ferment maltose, not even under oxygen-limited growth conditions, although this disaccharide supports rapid oxidative growth.},

  abstract = {Overflow metabolism in the form of aerobic acetate excretion by Escherichia coli is an important physiological characteristic of this common industrial microorganism. Although acetate formation occurs under conditions of high glucose consumption, the genetic mechanisms that trigger this phenomenon are not clearly understood. We report on the role of the NADH/NAD ratio (redox ratio) in overflow metabolism. We modulated the redox ratio in E. coli through the expression of Streptococcus pneumoniae (water-forming) NADH oxidase. Using steady-state chemostat cultures, we demonstrated a strong correlation between acetate formation and this redox ratio. We furthermore completed genome-wide transcription analyses of a control E. coli strain and an E. coli strain overexpressing NADH oxidase. The transcription results showed that in the control strain, several genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiration were repressed as the glucose consumption rate increased. Moreover, the relative repression of these genes was alleviated by expression of NADH oxidase and the resulting reduced redox ratio. Analysis of a promoter binding site upstream of the genes which correlated with redox ratio revealed a degenerate sequence with strong homology with the binding site for ArcA. Deletion of arcA resulted in acetate reduction and increased the biomass yield due to the increased capacities of the TCA cycle and respiration. Acetate formation was completely eliminated by reducing the redox ratio through expression of NADH oxidase in the arcA mutant, even at a very high glucose consumption rate. The results provide a basis for studying new regulatory mechanisms prevalent at reduced NADH/NAD ratios, as well as for designing more efficient bioprocesses.},
