\chapter{Monitoring Gene Expression Machinery during growth transitions}

This part is about the experiments. The preceding chapter made predictions about what should happen during transition if the micro-organisms actually optimize their biomass.
I describe here the strain construction, the choices we made (fluorescent reporter, subunit, single cell/pop, etc), the strain caracterisation (measured growth, signal-to-noise ratio,
the silly things mCherry was doing), and
